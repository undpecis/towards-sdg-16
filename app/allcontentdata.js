In addition, a number of places in the region exist where tensions between different ethnic, religious and political groups risk escalating into more formal conflicts.<br/>UNDP\'s work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding aims to promote social cohesion and empower nations and communities to become more inclusive and resilient to external and internal shocks. In order to achieve these aims, UNDP utilizes overlapping approaches with different focuses, which in the region can be classified into several broad categories:<br/>• Conflict Analysis and Risk Assessment – Sound analysis is not only central to understanding the causes and drivers of conflict, capacities for peace, and key stakeholders, but is also critical to developing strategic approaches for the UN system to comprehensively support national efforts to address conflicts and protect development gains.<br/>• Opening Dialogues and Confidence-Building – In areas where conflict and/or reoccurring violence have led to divisions, opening dialogues and confidence building aims to increase engagement and trust between people and communities on opposite sides of conflict divides by identifying and addressing shared challenges, and establishing formal frameworks to pre-empt future conflict.<br/>• Reconciliation and Peacebuilding – Where communities with a history of tension and conflict continue to live together, an increased emphasis on reconciliation and the prevention of violence is required to mitigate the higher risk of conflict re-emerging and sustain peace over the long term.<br/>• Conflict Management and Recovery – Typically combining elements of cross-border peacebuilding and confidence building, managing active conflict and facilitating recovery requires a specialized approach that also aims to reduce and eliminate violence, reintegrate internally displaced persons (IDPs), support reforms that address the causes of conflict, and identify priorities for rebuilding.'

                text: 'Protracted Conflicts and Ongoing<br/>Tension<br/>The ECIS region provides a wide and diverse range of examples of protracted conflict and conflict-related political complexity. These range from highly volatile situations with regular outbreaks of violence, to situations where conflict is not an immediate risk and/or sovereignty is not overtly contested, but where structural tensions, conflict drivers and/or the legacy of armed conflict have complicated the political landscape.<br/>The most recent, and arguably most significant, conflict to occur in the ECIS region since the end of the wars in the Western Balkans is the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Initiated by a series of events starting in 2013, the conflict continues in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. Despite a series of ceasefires negotiated over the past two years, regular violations continue to occur.<br/>In other parts of the ECIS region, ceasefires have ended formal conflicts and contributed to a fragile stability, but internationally mediated peace talks have, broadly, failed to bring lasting solutions.<br/>This can be seen in locations such as Transnistria in Moldova, the Nagorno-Karabakh14 region in Azerbaijan, and Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Often, in the absence of a political settlement, these conflicts continue in political form, perpetuating the divides in and polarisation of societies. The legacy of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia have similar qualities, as political challenges continue to haunt the region. Concessions arising from negotiations are often hard fought and suffer from a lack of support from the population, as was evidenced in 2015 by the large-scale protests in both Pristina and Belgrade after EU-brokered negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia.<br/>In BiH, the presence of a peace treaty has not addressed the country\'s divisions along ethnic lines, both politically and geographically. In 2015, several issues reinforced this polarization and placed a renewed strain on peacebuilding efforts. Similarly, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, tension between ethnic Albanians and Macedonians has led to occasional flare-ups, including a gun battle between Macedonian Police and ethnic Albanian gunmen in Kumanovo in May 2015.<br/>The Fergana Valley shared by Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan represents another source of volatility in the ECIS region. As a result of the multi-ethnic composition of the valley and the historical rivalries between those ethnic groups, disputes often arise due to the location of different ethnic communities across modern boundaries, and the need to share resources, such as arable land, water and transport.<br/>While many of these conflicts appear small and localized, they present a considerable threat to the wider European and Eurasian security architecture, with a risk that outbreaks of violence can spread quickly and/or lead to undesirable political and economic outcomes. It is also for this reason that developments that can exacerbate existing tensions, like the migration crisis in the Western Balkans and Turkey, or the economic slowdown impacting countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia, are carefully considered in the context of conflict prevention and peacebuilding.<br/>New and Old Threats from Violent<br/>Extremism<br/>Violent extremism in the ECIS region threatens to reverse the development gains made over the past twenty years. Some places are more impacted than others, with the situation in parts of the Western Balkans, Turkey and the Caucasus being particularly challenging. More recently, the threat level has been increasing substantially in Central Asia.<br/>Much of the discourse on violent extremism paints it as a religious phenomenon, and while religious drivers are a factor, this is not always the case. Many of the causes of violent extremism relate to a broad range of identity-based concerns, such as political exclusion of certain groups and ideologies around separatism. Broadly, radical ideologies are associated with high and extreme inequality and injustice (or the perception of inequality and injustice) – whether it be social, economic and political. Resorting to violence can therefore be understood as being motivated by hopelessness and frustration.<br/>Extremist organizations look to take advantage of this frustration by preying on vulnerable members of society, such as the marginalized and unemployed, particularly among the youth. Another group at a high risk are economic migrants, for example Central Asian migrants to Russia who, by virtue of being in a foreign country, are cut off from their normal social networks. Social and other forms of new media are also a factor in higher and more active means of recruitment.<br/>A relatively new threat that has emerged as a result of violent extremism, both in the ECIS region and in Western Europe, is that of individuals who opt to become foreign terrorist fighters. In the ECIS region, Turkey and Uzbekistan have seen the largest number of people leave to fight in foreign conflicts, at least partially due to their proximity to active conflicts (Syria and Afghanistan respectively), but several other countries and territories in the region have also seen significant numbers of citizens take up arms.<br/>In order to counter the violence of extremists, some governments in the ECIS region, particularly those in Central Asia, have used security responses and crackdowns, including restrictions on movement, assembly and free speech. This type of response often exacerbates the feelings of injustice and grievance already present, heightening the risk of further violent extremism and creating new populations that can be targeted by extremist recruiters.<br/>Some governments have also modified or introduced laws to ensure foreign fighters can be prosecuted when they return. However, due to the transnational nature of the phenomenon making it difficult to know whom among a population has become a foreign fighter or even how many there are, the effectiveness of this strategy appears limited.'

                text: 'Conflict Analysis and Risk Assessment<br/>UNDP has been working in contexts of conflict-related political complexity in the ECIS region for more than 15 years, particularly in partnership with the EU and the United Nations Department of Political Affairs (DPA). It has developed a range of tools in these contexts to drive an increasingly analytical and evidence-based approach, and has cultivated a strong knowledge base in effective programming that ranges from conflict-sensitive approaches to area-based development to more active work using development assistance to foster confidence in protracted conflict situations. The development mandate provides UNDP with political neutrality and substantial operational capacities to deliver development solutions in these challenging environments.<br/>Based on this extensive experience, UNDP\'s approach has two key dimensions:<br/>• Accurately identify and assess development needs and priorities at the local level, in order to effectively target assistance, and thus adhere to core principles of conflict sensitivity, including the \'do no harm\' philosophy; and<br/>• Directly engage with and facilitate inclusive participation of people at the community level in decision-making, to focus on addressing shared challenges and development issues at the inter-community level, irrespective of the higher level political context.<br/>A key pillar in UNDP\'s conflict analysis and risk assessment work, as well as conflict and peacebuilding programming more generally, is the deployment of Peace and Development Advisors, with the UNDP-DPA Joint Programme on Building National Capacities for Conflict Prevention being the primary facilitator of these deployments. This global programme, with support from the EU, enables access to a global network of specialized expertise at the local level, helping Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams analyse, adapt and respond to complex political development with conflict-sensitive programming. In 2015, Peace and Development Advisors were deployed in eight countries in the ECIS region.<br/>UNDP also has a number of other partners in its conflict analysis and risk assessment work. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has deployed Human Rights Advisors to provide guidance on navigating politically complex situations where human rights violations are in question and the Human Rights Up-Front mechanism has reviewed risks in specific countries in the region. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has also been an important and long-term partner in this work across the region.<br/>Opening Dialogues and ConfIence-Building<br/>With a goal of improving the relationships between people, communities and eventually populations that are divided due to conflict, UNDP employs a range of measures to open dialogues, build confidence, encourage interaction, and establish shared understanding.<br/>In Moldova, the absence of a political resolution to the Transnistria dispute and the functional separation of societies and political structures on both sides of the Dniester river has complicated future negotiations and hinders socio-economic development, stability and security. The protracted division has also led to the emergence of parallel systems, which in turn have created both practical and psychological barriers to inter-communal interactions. As such, UNDP\'s goals in affected border communities are to increase positive interactions and diminish the negative impact of high-level political disputes on the local populations.<br/>To achieve this, UNDP has been working in partnership with the EU since 2009 to employ a range of confidence building measures, including a combination of infrastructure works, capacity development initiatives, and financial support mechanisms for communities on both sides of the Dniester. Although activities tend to focus on reducing the isolation of Transnistria, they strive to balance the benefits received by both sides to avoid creating resentment or exacerbating tensions, and place priority on initiatives implemented by cross-river partnerships.<br/>Local development has also been a key focus during this work. Social infrastructure, such as the rehabilitation of shared healthcare institutions, community markets, roads, and educational institutions in strategic locations, often provides a place for individuals from different communities to interact and engage through common interests. Infrastructure projects also help to alleviate unemployment through the creation of short-term employment during the construction phase and long-term employment through agreements with the community to take over maintenance of the facilities.<br/>The integration of civil society has proven to be one of the more successful aspects of this work. With grant eligibility often conditional on the partnering of civil society organisations representing communities on both sides of the river, these projects have helped establish ongoing and meaningful partnerships.<br/>Similarly, in Georgia, UNDP has been using confidence building measures to help bring communities closer together on the ground. Working in partnership with the EU and the Kingdom of the Netherlands since 2010, the Confidence Building Early Response Mechanism (COBERM) programme is a status-neutral, apolitical and flexible programme designed to provide support to confidence building opportunities throughout Georgia (including the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia) at the grassroots level.<br/>At its core, COBERM is a small-scale grants facility for civil society organisations to strengthen their capacity to monitor and improve the accountability and transparency of authorities (both de jure and de facto). With improved skills and other capacities, and the financial motivation to re-establish connections across the conflict divide, there have been corresponding improvements in transparency and accountability, and a reduction in tensions and the potential for conflict.<br/>COBERM has also provided a platform for civil society organizations, together with local communities from conflict-affected areas, to identify conflict triggers and propose ways to address them in the form of development projects. The large number and wide geographical coverage of the grants, as well as the wide range of civil society partners, have ensured an increase in direct interactions across the conflict divides. This has provided numerous opportunities for joint cooperation on issues of common interest, normalizing cooperation between communities, and helping to establish sustainable partnerships involving youth groups, writers, farmers, linguists, and veterinarians. An independent evaluation has confirmed that COBERM is an effective model for confidence building and has changed the civil dialogue climate, which is particularly crucial in Georgia, where little progress has been made on the political front on bridging the divide between communities.<br/>In the South Caucasus, existing high tensions, including over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and the lack of any direct contact between civil society groups and/or other actors from Armenia and Azerbaijan, have created a situation where there is little opportunity to discuss possible paths forward. In an attempt to open up a new dialogue, the Peace and Development Advisor in Georgia took the lead in organising two roundtables with representatives from the UN and partner civil society organisations from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to discuss the future of the United Nation\'s development agenda and the \'World We Want\' in the South Caucasus. In this case, the SDGs offered an entry point for the UN in the South Caucasus to link peacebuilding and development. Civil society actors from the South Caucasus were brought together for an open joint discussion on common issues, with interactions between participants from all three countries remaining constructive, and a set of common issues, opportunities and challenges being agreed by everyone.<br/>Reconciliation and Peacebuilding<br/>In many places in the ECIS region, communities remain in close proximity and are required to interact on a daily basis despite the legacy of conflict and division. In these cases, UNDP\'s work focuses facilitating reconciliation and preventing outbreaks of violence.<br/>In 2014 and 2015, one of UNDP\'s major initiatives aimed to address ongoing tensions between communities in the border areas of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly in and around the Fergana Valley where communities are often in close proximity and not always in alignment with modern borders.<br/>UNDP\'s interventions were based on the assessment that much of the tension between these communities arises due to a lack of information. With local community leaders being important figures in these communities, UNDP provided these leaders with information on the challenges and risks facing their communities, allowing them to advocate for joint projects and activities with other communities to address those problems. As a result, this cooperative problem solving helped to normalize relationships, build trust, and reduce the potential for violent conflict.<br/>The project was designed on three pillars:<br/>• Providing Kyrgyz and Tajik community leaders with access to reliable and balanced information about local conflict dynamics and trends;<br/>• Strengthening local mechanisms for dialogue, deliberation, and problem-solving; and<br/>• Support for jointly agreed and jointly implemented activities to build trust and establish a pattern of practical cooperation between communities.<br/>To address the first pillar, a community-based conflict monitoring mechanism, TRACTION (TRends for ACTION), was developed to monitor the conflict situation based on a list of ten substantive policy areas including water resources, access to land, road/transport, and prevailing attitudes toward the other side. TRACTION also allows for the tracking of conflict likelihood over time, the categorization and quantification of reported disputes and clashes, and the identification of trends and patterns. With this information, themes and issues for community dialogues were identified, allowing the subsequent implementation of confidence-building infrastructure initiatives to remain focused on addressing specific conflict causes and drivers.<br/>The results of this cross-border intervention were so convincing that, in 2015, the UN country teams in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan developed a joint programme, supported by the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office Peacebuilding Fund and the Swiss Development Cooperation, to be implemented with assistance from five UN agencies between 2015 and 2017.<br/>Addressing the legacy of the conflicts in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia is also a focus of UNDP\'s engagement. In BiH, the Dialogue for the Future remains one of the flagship projects for reconciliation in the ECIS region, helping to address past grievances, bring together communities from different ethnic groups, and build understanding. To date, Dialogue for the Future has directly engaged over 54,000 citizens with Dialogue Platform Conferences, youth forums, trainings, and various grants facility projects. Similarly, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, UNDP is working to reconcile differences between ethnic Albanians and Macedonians in Kumanovo and Gostivar. With the goal of strengthening social cohesion among youth living in multi-ethnic areas, in 2015 this work focused on establishing youth councils, with workshops, trainings, street art performances and debates to raise awareness of the councils, as well as bringing youth from different communities together.<br/>Conflict Management and Recovery<br/>In situations where violence and conflict are still occurring, a different approach must be taken to peacebuilding that recognizes the fragility and dangers of the situation, as well as the risks of exacerbating violence and underlying tensions. UNDP\'s support in the ECIS region\'s most active conflict in Ukraine has centred around a two-pronged approach: supporting broad scale reform linked to the drivers of conflict and the Maidan protests, and facilitating recovery and peacebuilding, specifically in the Donbas region.<br/>At the national level, UNDP aims to facilitate government reform processes in several areas, including decentralisation, rule of law, human rights, voice and participation, anti-corruption, as well as those that seek to address the often difficult political, social and regional aspirations within Ukrainian society. A survey on decentralisation and the rights of women in rural areas was implemented in partnership with the Office of the Ombudsman, with the information collected by this survey to be used to help inform future decentralization reforms. UNDP has also been working extensively with local civil society and NGOs in the areas of decentralization, constitutional reform, and parliamentary development. Looking forward, two major projects are planned targeting parliamentary reform, and rule of law and community justice. Developed in 2015, these projects have now secured funding from the EU and the Netherlands respectively, ensuring UNDP\'s work in these areas can continue.<br/>In support of recovery, UNDP launched a Dialogue Support Platform to help improve coordination and cooperation between organizations working in Ukraine, allowing for the sharing of knowledge and expertise, and improving the impact of development efforts. UNDP also supported the provision of legal aid in conflict-affected communities, allowing people in those communities to seek justice without resorting to violence or other forms of retaliation. The Restoration of Governance and Reconciliation Project in the Donbas, with support of Switzerland and Sweden, also launched a number of important initiatives aimed at reducing social tension and enhancing the capacity of local governments to improve public service provision and include citizens in decision-making process. Funds from the EU will support expansion of the project to the implementation of decentralization reform and the strengthening of gender equality impact in cooperation with UN Women.<br/>As a framework for this work in 2015, UNDP helped to coordinate and complete the Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment of government controlled areas of Eastern Ukraine. Aimed at providing a review of the current state of governance and infrastructure in conflict-affected areas, the assessment was widely circulated amongst national and international stakeholders and formally endorsed through a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers, establishing it as a government-owned framework for prioritizing recovery and peacebuilding programming in the short to medium term.<br/>Following up on the assessment, UNDP has provided technical support to the inter-ministerial working group charged with implementing the Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment. Already this work has led to a draft resolution on the establishment of a Council for Donbas Recovery. This council, when established, will serve as a high-level forum for policy dialogue with international partners on rolling out the Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment, under the Government\'s leadership.<br/>Finally, with a risk of conflict spreading to neighbouring areas, UNDP performed an early assessment of the risks to inter-community relations, and the implementation of the steps to mitigate those risks. This included confidence-building measures and dialogues at the local level in four neighbouring oblasts (Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson).'

In order to achieve these aims, UNDP utilizes overlapping approaches with different focuses, which in the region can be classified into several broad categories:<br/>• Conflict Analysis and Risk Assessment – Sound analysis is not only central to understanding the causes and drivers of conflict, capacities for peace, and key stakeholders, but is also critical to developing strategic approaches for the UN system to comprehensively support national efforts to address conflicts and protect development gains.<br/>• Opening Dialogues and Confidence-Building – In areas where conflict and/or reoccurring violence have led to divisions, opening dialogues and confidence building aims to increase engagement and trust between people and communities on opposite sides of conflict divides by identifying and addressing shared challenges, and establishing formal frameworks to pre-empt future conflict.<br/>• Reconciliation and Peacebuilding – Where communities with a history of tension and conflict continue to live together, an increased emphasis on reconciliation and the prevention of violence is required to mitigate the higher risk of conflict re-emerging and sustain peace over the long term.<br/>• Conflict Management and Recovery – Typically combining elements of cross-border peacebuilding and confidence building, managing active conflict and facilitating recovery requires a specialized approach that also aims to reduce and eliminate violence, reintegrate internally displaced persons (IDPs), support reforms that address the causes of conflict, and identify priorities for rebuilding.'

In recent years, Albania has suffered from an economic slowdown, with growth falling to an estimated 2.6 percent in 2015,33 unemployment increasing to 17.3 percent, and youth unemployment rising sharply to 32.1 percent.34 <br/>Despite this, there were some positive developments in 2015. In May, an overwhelming majority of the parliament approved a resolution recommending legal reform based on the ‘National Plan of Measures on the Protection of LGBTI People (2012-2014)’ launched by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Youth as a step toward EU accession. The parliament passed controversial legislation to open the files of the Sigurimi (‘secret’) police who are believed to have killed and deported thousands of Albanians during the communist period. Steps were also taken to prevent violent extremism, particularly amongst youth, and highlight Albania’s history of religious tolerance, with a strategy on Countering Violent Extremism adopted and a Balkans Regional Summit held.<br/>Albania held local elections in June 2015, completing a radical overhaul to local governance structures that resulted in 61 new consolidated municipalities. The elections were generally seen to be free and fair, with the participation of 63 political parties, 158 candidates for mayor and 36,341 candidates for local councils. All parties also met the new requirement for local council candidate lists to include equal numbers of men and women. However, the elections were not without issues, with OSCE election monitors noting "politicization of state institutions" and "many cases of group voting and some important procedural irregularities."<br/>A number of other challenges also remain. Corruption persists in many sectors, as is reflected by a score of 36/100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index.35 To combat domestic violence and human trafficking, the Government has developed a number of initiatives and strategies, but implementation remains incomplete. Implementation of social policies for the inclusion of vulnerable groups, particularly the Roma and Egyptian communities, and people with disabilities, has also been inadequate. Finally, UNDP-supported Trust in Government surveys show very low levels of public confidence in many governmental institutions, including the Parliament, the judiciary and political parties.'

                text:'The successful local elections in 2015 were a milestone in the territorial and administrative reform process that was heavily supported through the flagship Support to Territorial and Administrative Reform (STAR) programme. In 2015, this programme focused on building the capacity of the new LGUs to ensure a smooth transition after the elections. Training was provided to 244 local professionals from 61 municipal working groups on how to perform municipal due diligence and engage in the amalgamation/consolidation processes for the new municipalities. A practical guide, tailored for each new LGU in accordance with their specific needs and characteristics, was provided to the new mayors\' cabinets. These guides include detailed instructions for a smooth transfer of functions and responsibilities from the former LGUs. Support was also provided to 26 smaller LGUs in designing their short-term Local Development Operational Plans, which will serve as blueprints for the new municipalities for the next 2-3 years. Furthermore, the changeover is being used as an opportunity to modernize services, with one-stop shops offering services through a single desk piloted in two LGUs, and one LGU also piloting a new data management system and the digitization of their archives.<br/>In a significant gain for gender equality, the Albanian Parliament legislated a 50 percent women\'s quota for the candidates for the June 2015 local elections. UNDP\'s support in this initiative included the development of the legislation, and the creation of advocacy and lobbying partnerships such as women\'s organizations, parliamentary commissions and the women parliamentary caucus. The end result was a milestone achievement of women being elected in approximately 35 percent of all positions across the 61 municipal councils, as compared to around 12 percent in 2011. Female representation in the national parliament has also seen large improvements.<br/>To assess the state of gender inequality in the court system, UNDP supported a review by a local NGO of 655 divorce case decisions from the Tirana District Court. The review showed that in 82.9 percent of cases there was no enforcement of court orders on child alimony and no alternative support provided by law enforcement agencies. This often placed an additional burden on women who were typically already in a difficult socio-economic situation. The analysis also provided important insights into the unequal distribution of assets amongst men and women in divorce cases.<br/>UNDP has also been active in the fight against domestic and gender-based violence, establishing coordinated community response mechanisms in four municipalities, with a focus on preventive action and systems of protection. In addition, existing mechanisms were expanded in two additional municipalities to cover a larger area due to the amalgamation of government units. As a result, in 2015 there was a 30 percent increase in reported cases, a 35 percent increase in requests for the State Police to issue Protection Orders from 2013, and a 24 percent increase in arrests for family crimes from 2014. Complementing this work, UNDP has also helped victims with rehabilitation and reintegration, leading to 47 percent of victims being successfully employed as compared to 38 percent in 2014. Furthermore, UNDP supported NGOs and volunteers in the 16 days of activism campaign against gender-based violence. As a result, leaders of the five main religious communities signed cooperation agreements with the Ministry of Social Welfare and Youth to advocate for gender equality, fight against gender-based violence, and implement the national action plan to involve men and boys in these issues.37<br/>UNDP supported Roma and Egyptian communities and civil society organizations to help improve human rights and social inclusion. This included encouraging participation in local planning processes, the prioritization local infrastructure development, and, in partnership with NGOs, providing free legal aid to 165 Roma and Egyptians families in three municipalities. Activists were also supported within their communities to engage women in social change activities, such as UNDP facilitated forums for Roma and Egyptian women to discuss how to better advocate for their rights. Furthermore, a separate initiative provided job training and assistance to 341 people from the Roma and Egyptian communities in Korca, Berat and Vlora. All of these initiatives were complemented by a participatory process involving civil society, municipalities and line ministries which led to the finalization of the ‘Action Plan for Integration of Roma and Egyptians in the Republic of Albania 2016-2020\'.<br/>Finally, in efforts to combat corruption, UNDP assisted the National Coordinator for Anti-Corruption in setting-up a public portal for citizens to report corruption and service delivery failures. As a result, 10,214 reports were made using the portal in 2015, with 6,527 of these cases were referred for further action. An initial survey was also carried out to gauge public awareness of the portal and the level of confidence in these tools. The portal software was further enhanced in 2016 to further strengthen the function of the National Coordinator on Anti-Corruption.'

Despite progress, the functioning of the justice system continues to be affected by politicization, limited accountability, a lack of cooperation between institutions, and corruption. These shortcomings are also reflected in the legal aid system where there are significant procedural, economic and physical barriers preventing vulnerable communities from securing access to justice.<br/>Vulnerable communities also continue to face obstacles, such as finding housing solutions, employment and social inclusion, as well as accessing welfare and government services. Gender inequality, women’s rights and domestic violence also remain significant issues, although it is hoped that a larger female representation in local councils and expansion of Coordinated Community Response Systems in the new amalgamated municipalities will help efforts to address these issues going forward.<br/>UNDP will work with justice institutions to implement reforms and improve access to justice. With the results of the review of gender inequality in the justice system now completed, UNDP hopes to push for several reforms including alternative solutions for state compensation of child alimony in divorce cases, especially for victims of domestic violence.<br/>UNDP also plans to continue supporting the increased effectiveness of municipal governance by working both at the local and national level. With the formation of the new larger municipalities, these efforts will include expanded and improved initiatives to provide training, assist the development of operational plans, and modernize service provision. Going forward, UNDP and key partners will also increase assistance to local governance through measures aimed at strengthening local democracy and improving service delivery reorganization and efficiency of LGUs in reaching citizens. Partnerships with and training for civil society organizations will enable participation in decision-making processes and service delivery, as well as the assessment of the performance of service delivery, public administration, and anti-corruption and integrity initiatives. Anti-corruption work is also expected to be expanded, with citizen feedback to be used to push for meaningful reforms to address corruption and service delivery failures. Further research will be undertaken to see how UNDP can support the continued transition from the communist era, particularly with the opening of the Sigurimi files, as well as on how UNDP can support community efforts to prevent any emergence of violent extremism.'

Since 2003, the country has experienced steady development, despite the impact of the 2009 financial crisis and the unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia has implemented a number of EU-inspired reforms and maintains a relationship with the EU, as well as economic ties with the Russian Federation and other countries in the region. In 2015, Armenia became a member of the Eurasian Economic Union.<br/>Armenia is making efforts to establish a functional democracy and good governance by improving its legal and regulatory mechanisms. The Strategy for Legal and Judicial Reforms (2012-2016) aims to improve the legal framework, increase access to justice and strengthen the independence of the judiciary. Yet, corruption remains a serious issue in Armenia, with the 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index showing that Armenia scored 35/100, and that it had regressed from 2014.40 Public mistrust of the justice system and its integrity remain especially high,41 with further reforms necessary to strengthen the rule of law.<br/>There were several important reviews and events in 2015. In January, Armenia underwent its second UPR. 189 recommendations were received as a result of this process, 155 of which were fully accepted. In May, Armenia received the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, whose initial comments indicate certain gaps in the current institutional child protection framework. This was followed by a visit from the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in October, with the Commissioner noting "persisting reports of torture and ill-treatment by the police and other law enforcement agencies, often with a view to obtaining confessions, are of major concern."<br/>Finally, in December, a referendum was held on constitutional amendments proposed by the ruling party that would move Armenia from a presidential to a parliamentary system.

During this process, the fibre optic and gas network was also extended to seven neighbouring communities, providing access to the fibre optic network for 56,000 people, and to the gas network for 1,200 households. UNDP also contributed to the drafting of the Standard Operating Procedures for the Bagratashen border crossing point and developed protocols for the implementation of an advanced online customs data exchange between customs authorities of both countries. Finally, UNDP also finalized a draft agreement on border delegates between Georgia and Armenia, which is currently with the respective foreign ministries for clearance.<br/>In efforts to boost innovation in governance, UNDP helped establish an innovation hub within the Government. Using expertise from UK-based specialists FutureGov, and a study tour for the Government to the Danish organization, MindLab, UNDP supported the co-design of a new Open Governance Centre concept and a TEDx event on public sector innovation.43<br/>Innovation also played an important role as UNDP\'s Kolba Lab led an initiative to increase public engagement with government. Through crowdsourcing, social innovation camps and hackathons, 20 citizen-led projects in local governance, human rights, and the green economy were generated. These projects are currently at various stages of prototyping and have involved around 350 active citizens, civil servants and members of civil society organizations. Kolba also lent support to Armenia\'s OGP engagement, using crowdsourcing44 to encourage citizen inputs for the national OGP strategy for 2016-2018.<br/>UNDP has also been working to combat one of the primary drivers of disengagement – corruption. Bolstered by the formation of a new Anti-Corruption Council chaired by the Prime Minister, UNDP contributed to the development of a new anti-corruption strategy for 2015-2018. Now formally adopted by the Government, the strategy will target four main areas – healthcare, education, revenue collection and the police.<br/>To advance women\'s rights and empowerment, UNDP supported the political participation of women at the local level by implementing capacity development programmes for 490 women. As a result, 20 women ran for election in 37 communities, with 19 being elected. To enlarge the pool of women vying for seats in the local elections in 2016, an additional 204 women were trained on leadership, community development, local governance, gender equality and participatory democracy. Furthermore, UNDP\'s Women in Local Democracy programme code-designed, prototyped and tested \'women-to-women\' mentorship schemes and \'I am the Community\' leadership camps. The latter resulted in 26 self-sustaining community initiatives in 21 communities.<br/>In a positive development for the rights of people with disabilities, UNDP supported a comprehensive government reform to change the disability classification model from a medical to a biopsychosocial model,45 a move supported by the UN Partnership for the Rights of People with Disabilities. This brings it into line with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and the CRPD. With joint support from UNDP and UNICEF, 300 medical experts, social workers and other respective personnel were trained to carry out the reform in the initial phase. Armenia is one of the leading countries in this initiative, with assessment tools already developed and piloted with 1,200 people.

This has resulted in one of the highest standards of living among the former republics of the Soviet Union, even if questions remain over the sustainability of this strategy.<br/>The major event in 2015 was the presidential election in October, which resulted in President Alexander Lukashenko winning his fifth term in office with over 83 percent of the vote.48 This win continues his run of winning every presidential election since independence in 1991. In a positive step, the election was immediately preceded by the release of six opposition figures on humanitarian grounds. This gesture, along with the relative lack of violence during the election, was enough to convince EU foreign ministers to lift sanctions that had been in place since 2004, ending asset freezes and travel bans against 170 individuals, including Lukashenko himself.<br/>In another positive development, the Government adopted the ‘National Sustainable Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2030\', which includes a commitment to transparency and openness in public administration. The first phase aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governance, expand the roles and areas of responsibility of local governance and self-governance, as well as modernizing and professionalizing the civil service at central and local levels. These have been identified as the primary targets to improve the quality and accessibility of public services.<br/>At the same time, the Government has shown a strong commitment to the UPR process and has engaged with the UN and civil society organizations in the country to ensure follow-up on the accepted recommendations. Despite these positive signs and some improvements, the human rights situation in Belarus remains under close scrutiny from international organizations, including OHCHR and OSCE. Belarus also continues to rank poorly in international ratings and reports on civic and political freedoms.'

                text: 'Since 2014, UNDP has been running a large-scale local development programme in all six regions in Belarus, with the purpose of facilitating citizen engagement in planning and development at the local and regional level. In 2015, this project started yielding results with UNDP supporting the drafting of participatory development documents for all 118 districts. These documents identify unique challenges and opportunities for each district, and provide guidelines for engaging public, private and civil society organizations to address them. The next phase of the project will see UNDP providing grants to local organizations and individuals for initiatives to address the identified challenges and opportunities. In preparation for this next stage, UNDP helped train local organizations on the grant application process and project management best practices.<br/>To improve public administration performance, following on from the adoption of the \'National Sustainable Socio Economic Development Strategy 2030’, the Government sought UNDP assistance to deliver more inclusive and responsive public services. As a first step, UNDP coordinated an international conference on the central role of transparent, inclusive and responsive institutions, both in delivering on the SDG agenda, and in ensuring inclusive and accessible quality services are provided to all citizens. The conference resulted in commitments from the authorities at central and regional levels, and all stakeholders to work together towards enhancing the capacity of civil servants and improving the opportunities for citizens to influence the delivery of public services.<br/>The new SDG agenda was also the main focus of a massive one-week partnership building, communication and advocacy campaign. Led by UNDP in partnership with a number of UN agencies, the main feature was a train caravan, the UN70 Express, that travelled across Belarus in October, bringing on board hundreds of people representing public, private and civil society partners, donors, international organizations, and vulnerable groups. Stopping in all six regional capitals and Minsk to discuss issues around the SDGs and their relevance for Belarus, the campaign drew over 30,000 participants to more than 250 events. In addition, the Governors of the six regions and Minsk signed declarations committing to the new agenda.<br/>In the security sector, UNDP supported the State Border Committee with its conversion from a military body to a law enforcement agency, with reforms focusing on both infrastructure and capacity building. Two buildings of the Border Training Institute went through significant physical improvements, including the reconstruction of a three-storey dormitory and one-storey training facility. The Strategy on Psychological Support Service Development was also approved as a guiding framework for work with vulnerable groups of migrants, and as a general resource for State Border Committee personnel. In addition, a State Border Committee Human Resources Development and Training Strategy was developed in line with EU best practices and officially approved by the Committee in April 2016. UNDP played a leading role coordinating key all stakeholders to ensure they are responsive to the needs of vulnerable migrants and victims of human trafficking.<br/>Although human rights remain a sensitive area in Belarus, UNDP was able to advance the human rights agenda in 2015. Firstly, with UNDP assistance, the dialogue between the Government and civil society was expanded to include a number of key issues, including the death penalty, creation of a NHRI, and the drafting of a National Human Rights Action Plan. Following a sustained campaign by UNDP, Belarus signed the CRPD in September. UNDP also supported the follow up on the 2nd cycle UPR in May and organized a successful visit of Belarusian officials to Washington, DC in December with a series of meetings on human rights and rule of law issues with the US State Department.<br/>UNDP has also been expanding the use of innovation and technology to address existing challenges, including citizen based approaches such as social innovation labs. UNDP developed with the National Centre of Legislation and Legal Research an innovative prototype public e-feedback mechanism. The existing system of citizen feedback to public authorities, based on citizen appeals, was reviewed together with the best practices from the country and the region, and used to develop a new online system that is user-friendly for people with disabilities and can be adapted for all government websites.<br/>The use of innovation and technology has also resulted in a shift in the way that UNDP and the authorities are working to combat corruption and the informal economy. In an initiative expected to generate ongoing dividends, UNDP facilitated the visit of the Behavioural Insight Team from the UK government to work with the Ministry of Finance and tax officers in Minsk. During this visit, interventions were designed to facilitate informal workers being reintegrated back into the formal economy.'

Despite these expected fiscal pressures, UNDP will continue working closely with the Government, civil society organizations and private sector partners to continue on the path to a fairer and more open society.<br/>Planned work includes the rolling out of a long-term comprehensive rule of law and access to justice programme, continuing advocacy for the establishment of a NHRI, and implementation of a National Human Rights Action Plan as part of the UPR follow-up process. In addition, UNDP will proceed with publication of materials from the International Conference ‘Death Penalty: Transcending the Divide\' held in March 2016 and will continue the dialogue on the death penalty with the Parliament.<br/>Efforts are planned to support the rights of people with disabilities. With the ratification of the CRPD in late 2016, UNDP plans to work closely with other UN agencies and national partners on the implementation of needed reforms. This will be complemented by a nationwide two-month advocacy and awareness raising campaign: ‘Inclusive Belarus\'. UNDP will also work to boost national gender equality mechanisms and to support an assessment of where inequality continues to have the most significant impacts.<br/>UNDP will also continue providing support and assistance to the Government\'s planned changes to improve the performance of public administration. In early 2016, UNDP launched a 3-year project to support public administration in building the capacities of civil servants, and making local governance and public service delivery more responsive to citizens. The project will improve the selection, training and performance assessment of civil servants at all levels, strengthen public engagement in planning and implementation processes, and boost the ability of the public and civil society to conduct monitoring of public services and provide feedback. In order to achieve these goals, the project will test a range of initiatives and will pilot two integrated customer service centres.<br/>Finally, UNDP will continue to use innovation to enhance the influence and reach of its efforts. After the positive response to the pilot e-feedback system in 2015, further testing and development of the system will be undertaken as it moves towards a full rollout. UNDP\'s anti-corruption work will also continue, with the interventions designed in partnership with the UK Government\'s Behavioural Insight Team expected to begin implementation. As a result of this work, a team of tax officers from Moldova that participated in the event is also expected to launch its own initiative.'

However, in many cases progress has been slow due to political deadlocks, and accompanying economic and financial difficulties.<br/>The governance structure of BiH is unique in the region as a result of the complex peace negotiation process in 1995 and the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords (which includes the BiH Constitution). This structure means the state is assigned with limited responsibilities, with most of the political and financial power resting with two entities and a district (the Republika Srpska, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Brcko District). This has led to a high level of political polarization, as evidenced by the challenges from the Republika Srpska authorities to the legitimacy of state-level authorities and BiH sovereignty, unresolved issues in the education sector such as two schools under one roof, and the unresolved status of the city of Mostar, where failure to reach an agreement on the administrative structure led to exclusion from another local elections cycle.<br/>The overall socio-economic and political situation, including high rates of unemployment (specifically among youth) and a sense of social apathy, is also believed to be a driver of a number of citizens becoming foreign fighters in Syria, Ukraine, and other conflict-affected countries. With concerns over the consequences of these fighters returning home, as well as the large quantities of weapons remaining from the war in the 1990s, the BiH Council of Ministers released the \'Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina for Prevention and Combating Terrorism\' in 2015. BiH has also outlawed participation in foreign conflicts (either as a fighter or recruiter)49 and jailed the first people under this law,50 with more arrests and convictions occurring through late 2015 and early 2016.<br/>In 2015, BiH placed greater emphasis on reform processes through the adoption of the Reform Agenda and official submission of the EU application. In efforts to sustain peace, events such as the visit of Pope Francis and the reopening of the National Museum after three years provided an important boost to the campaign to promote coexistence and diversity throughout the country. This came on top of the solidarity seen in the immediate response to the May 2014 floods (the most devastating that the country has seen in decades)51 and the continuing flood-recovery efforts.'

Dialogue for the Future has directly engaged over 54,000 citizens through two Dialogue Platform Conferences, 26 youth forums, and 40 grants facility projects, which has resulted in a formal process that enables citizens and decision makers to interact and discuss peace- and trust-building. Dialogue for the Future has also reached a huge audience, including over 1,350 positive stories, 20 televised reports with an estimated 890,560 viewers, 27,494 YouTube and 135,419 Facebook views, and 3,680 social platform users. In total, it is estimated that 1,138,084 persons, or close to 30 percent of the population, have been engaged in peacebuilding issues.<br/>To improve access to justice, in coordination with the Ministry of Justice of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, UNDP established a new free legal aid agency to ensure access to free legal aid services and information for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities and women.<br/>With this addition, the total number of free legal aid agencies now stands at 16, enabling access to free legal aid services for more than 800,000 citizens. Implementation of small grants programmes also significantly increased the territorial coverage and access to free legal aid in rural and remote areas. During 2015, 11,637 women and 10,332 men received free legal aid services in all types of cases and court proceedings.<br/>UNDP also supported the implementation of the Justice Sector Reform and National War Crimes Prosecution Strategies by facilitating better cooperation among war crimes prosecution offices in the region, speeding up the processing of war crimes cases that have a regional dimension. UNDP further supported the continued expansion and improvement of the Victim-Witness Support programme to 16 fully operational offices. These offices assisted over 1,600 people in 2015.<br/>UNDP is also working on a joint UN project in partnership with IOM, UNFPA and UN Women to strengthen the ability of the judiciary, the police and the media to prosecute and report on CRSV in BiH. This joint programme, amongst other things, has provided training to representatives of the judiciary, police and media on survivors\' rights and standards for processing of war crimes cases involving sexual violence.<br/>Initiated in 2009, LOD (Reinforcement of Local Democracy) is a project which aims to improve cooperation between local governments and civil society organizations, contributing to better service delivery for excluded and vulnerable population groups. The project focuses on enhancing transparency and accountability of public spending at the local level, strengthening partnerships between local governments and civil society organizations, the realization of grass-root initiatives and increasing the capacities of civil society organizations. Implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and various associations of municipalities and cities, LOD has worked in partnership with 50 partner local governments and 243 civil society organizations to support the implementation of 289 projects based on the needs of local communities. To date, this project has benefitted over 81,000 people.<br/>To combat corruption, in 2015, UNDP trained key law enforcement agencies and created a governance model for improved coordination among stakeholders involved in the fight against corruption in order to enable more efficient and effective identification and prosecution of corruption cases going forward.<br/>In work to diminish the legacy of the war, UNDP in coordination with the Ministry of Defence, contributed to the disposal of 2,452 tons of unsafe ammunition, reducing the quantity of remaining ammunition surpluses to 12,000 tons. Due to the optimization of ammunition disposal processes, the overall rate of disposal was increased almost threefold, thus reducing the overall expected time of completion of addressing the issue of unsafe stockpile ammunition to five years. Five out of seven ammunition and weapons storage sites were also upgraded through the reconstruction of facilities, drainage, and ventilation systems as part of this process.'

Unemployment, though still high, declined to 28 percent in 2014 and 26.1 percent in 2015. However, some of this decline stemmed from discouraged job-seekers dropping out or emigrating; youth unemployment rose in 2015 to 50 percent. The share of the population at risk of poverty, defined in line with EU standards, continued to fall, from 26.2 percent in 2012, to 24.2 percent in 2013, and to 22.1 percent in 2014.85 The 2015 Human Development Report put the country in the high human development category, with a human development index of 0.747.86 <br/>The country\'s political environment remained fraught. Having boycotted the Parliament since the 2014 early parliamentary elections, the main opposition party in early 2015 made public dozens of wiretapped conversations that implicated leading government officials in corruption, electoral fraud, surveillance and intimidation of political opponents, and direct meddling in the judiciary, police and media. These revelations inspired widespread indignation and a wave of protests. Visiting the country in May 2015, UN Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic voiced "deep concern" at "serious challenges to the rule of law and the shrinking of the democratic space." 87<br/>Similar concerns brought the intervention of the EU and the US, which oversaw difficult negotiations among the four main political parties. These yielded an agreement June and July 2015 designed to re-direct political conflict into appropriate institutional channels. The terms of the ‘Przino Agreement,88 included sweeping reforms (particularly in the rule of law and media), the creation of a Special Prosecutor\'s Office (SPO) to investigate the wiretaps, the return of the opposition to the Parliament and the resignation of long-serving Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski ahead of early elections. 89<br/>Adherence to the Przino Agreement was at best partial, and its implementation was a source of contention into 2016, particularly owing to the exclusion of civil society from the process. Early elections were scheduled twice only to be cancelled, and 11 December 2016 was only agreed as the final date under renewed international pressure. Without a greater commitment to reform, however, elections alone are unlikely to end the protracted crisis. Przino\'s most important achievement has been the creation of the SPO. Although it faces widespread resistance, it has opened cases against many high-ranking officials, and a 2016 poll shows its chief to be the country\'s most-trusted figure. 90<br/>Political tensions were heightened in May, when an "anti-terrorist" action launched by police in the multi-ethnic city of Kumanovo resulted in the deaths of eight elite security troops and ten ethnic Albanian gunmen. The exact circumstances of the incident remain unknown, but it served as a reminder of what the European Commission has called the "fragile"91 state of inter-ethnic relations.<br/>The country also faced a potent humanitarian challenge in 2015, in the form of an estimated 900,000 refugees and migrants – most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan – who crossed the country on their journey to wealthier EU countries in the north. State institutions were initially slow to react, but transit centres were eventually established at southern and northern borders, registration procedures were adopted and vulnerable groups provided with assistance. Host communities in Gevgelija and Kumanovo faced a particular burden in serving the transit centres while at the same time maintaining an adequate level of public services to local residents. The crisis eased with the full closure of irregular borders in March 2016, though the treatment of the small numbers of refugees who remain in the country continues to raise human rights concerns.92<br/>Two natural disasters also struck in 2015. February floods in the Pelagonija and Southeast regions caused an estimated US$35.7 million in damage, and flash floods and landslides in the Polog region in August 2015 cost six lives and caused US$21.5 million in damage in Tetovo and nearby villages.'

Here waste management and water supply quickly emerged as the most urgent challenges, in which the refugee crisis exacerbated existing shortcomings in public services.<br/>In the early days, UNDP provided new garbage trucks, containers and other waste-management equipment to Gevgelija and Kumanovo. Then, with US$2.3 million in funding from the Government of Japan, UNDP developed plans to double the drinking water supply for Gevgelija by repairing a local well and to relocate the municipal landfill from the banks of the Vardar River to a more ecologically suitable location. In the north, in Kumanovo, UNDP undertook to repair a local road damaged by the heavy equipment needed to service the transit centre in Tabanovce, and to refurbish a multi-ethnic primary school. UNDP also provided assistance to the Crisis Management Centre (CMC) to improve emergency response.<br/>These efforts built on UNDP\'s long-standing efforts to improve governance at the local level, particularly supporting completion of the decentralization process, which in the country is dedicated not only to bringing local institutions closer to the public but also to promoting inter-ethnic cohesion.<br/>To this end, UNDP supported the Ministry of Local Self-Government to prepare a new Programme and Action Plan for Sustainable Local Development and Decentralization for the 2015-2020 period. This was noted as one of few areas of progress in the European Commission\'s 2015 report on EU accession. The policy process was enriched by data from a UNDP-led survey on citizens\' satisfaction with local government services, disaggregated data from planning regions and a study on local e-services.<br/>At the regional level, with funding from the Ministry of Local Self-Government, UNDP helped to replicate models for alternative service provision that were pioneered in the Vardar Planning Region. To boost local development and help mitigate the effects of multiple crises, new centres to support private business were established in five planning regions and a centre for rural development was created in the Northeast Planning Region. At local level, UNDP aided municipalities in addressing the needs of vulnerable groups and people with disabilities.<br/>To help address high rates of youth unemployment and emigration, UNDP worked in 2015 with the Agency of Youth and Sport to prepare a new National Youth Strategy for 2016-2025. UNDP\'s role was to ensure the process was fully participatory; the strategy preparation involved more than 65 workshops, public debates and local meetings, engaging more than 95 youth organizations and informal groups. UNDP also worked to encourage social cohesion, focusing on the local youth councils in Kumanovo and Gostivar. 30 workshops, trainings, street art performances and debates were organized to raise awareness of the councils and bring youth from different communities together.<br/>Increasing the participation of women in public life was another priority. Although mandatory quotas have secured 34 percent of the seats in the Parliament for women, currently only two of 25 cabinet ministers, and only four of 81 municipal mayors are women. Thanks to good timing, cooperation with civil society and other UN agencies and support from women politicians from both ruling and opposition parties, the quota for "the less represented sex" was increased from 30 percent to 40 percent. As a result, the country is likely to have one of the highest shares of female parliamentary representation in the world in 2017.'

The dispute over the country\'s name will block progress and the EU will itself suffer deep divisions over major issues. The country\'s position as "gatekeeper" to the Western Balkans migration route will keep it at centre stage in migration discussions and continue to raise human rights concerns.<br/>UNDP governance work will continue to focus on the local level, while also addressing democratic deficits and rule-of-law challenges pertinent to the EU accession agenda and the relevant UN conventions. Following an in-depth preparatory phase, a US$3.3 million Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)-funded four-year project is in place to help municipal councils strengthen their oversight and outreach functions, particularly on budget, gender and inter-ethnic issues.<br/>Building on a long tradition of inter-municipal cooperation, UNDP will also continue assisting regional development centres in extending services to people with disabilities and in building regional competiveness, including through mapping of rural tourism potential. Past work in innovating tools for transparency, accountability and integrity will be integrated into these efforts.<br/>In addition, UNDP will continue to forge partnerships with civil society and institutional actors to promote the open governance agenda, and explore its connections with the SDGs.<br/>UNDP governance work will continue to complement the humanitarian response to the refugee crisis with a sustainable local-level development response. The efforts will aim to help the municipalities of Gevgelija and Kumanovo build resilience for potential future crises while improving the delivery of utilities and other public services to local residents. UNDP will also continue supporting the CMC, municipalities and other institutions to build crisis-response capabilities, with a focus on updating the online crisis management system.<br/>In the area of social cohesion and youth, UNDP will launch an initiative to promote social cohesion in ethnically diverse Kumanovo. This project will create youth-friendly spaces for inclusive dialogue and serve as a platform for youth-driven activities that will meet local needs, address the migrant crisis, and bring the community together.'

In particular, the peaceful transition of power following the parliamentary elections in 2012 showed the maturity of democracy and rule of law. However, since winning that election, the Georgian Dream party has seen two Prime Ministers resign, most recently when Irakli Garibashvili resigned in December 2015, less than a year ahead of the 2016 parliamentary elections.<br/>In the last 10 years, Georgia has undertaken a number of reforms in the areas of human rights and rule of law, including the adoption of a Criminal Justice Reform Strategy, a Civic Integration Strategy, a National Human Rights Strategy and Personal Data Protection and Anti-discrimination legislation. It has also adopted new legislation that increases the independence of the judiciary, the establishment of an independent legal aid service, and the improvement of prison conditions. Georgia is also undertaking significant reforms to decentralize power to the regions. All of these reforms require further support to ensure adequate implementation.<br/>Georgia has long prioritized integration into the EU and Euro-Atlantic structures, and in June 2014, took a significant step by signing an Association Agreement with the EU. This agreement, which includes joining the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, significantly deepens political and economic ties with Europe. Georgia has also acceded to a number of international treaties on human rights, including the CRPD.<br/>Despite the progress to date though, several challenges remain in Georgia. Most prominently, inequality and unemployment remain high, and the protracted conflicts in the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are still unresolved.'

                text: 'The continued improvement of human rights is a key priority for UNDP in Georgia. UNDP’s focus has been to support the National Human Rights Strategy and the implementation of the Action Plan adopted in 2014, as well as the formulation of a new 2016-2017 Action Plan. Reforms to the criminal justice system, judiciary, penitentiary system and personal data protection are to be implemented by the National Human Rights Council. As a member (without voting power) of this National Council, UNDP contributed directly to monitoring the implementation of the action plan and confirming progress against benchmarks.<br/>Steps are also being taken towards greater transparency, with the Georgian Parliament engaging in the OGP Initiative and adopting a Parliamentary Openness Action Plan in July 2015, one of the first parliaments in the world to do so. With UNDP actively supporting and facilitating, the Parliament developed the plan through a consultative process involving civil society organizations, and it includes commitments to promote public involvement in the legislative process, access to information, as well as new technologies and innovation to reform Parliament’s web services and accountability. The Georgian Parliament has already started to implement up to 18 openness commitments by establishing the Permanent Parliamentary Council on Open and Transparent Governance to monitor the implementation of the commitments and ensure sustainability and local ownership of the process. A number of web innovations were also introduced and legislative amendments prepared to advance transparency and citizen engagement. As an acknowledgement of its commitment to openness and effective cooperation with civil society, the Georgian parliament was awarded the global OGP Government Champions Award in October 2015. ssBuilding on recent decentralization reforms, UNDP assisted national, regional and local authorities to continue with the reform process. In a significant step, a new Law on Mountainous Regions Development was adopted in July 2015, after intensive policy consultations involving the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure, other Ministries and the Parliament. This law is designed to provide substantial social, economic and business benefits, together with a guarantee of annual funds from the national budget reserved for mountain development. UNDP also supported the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure to reach agreement with other ministries on 30 separate amendments promoting the decentralization of power to municipalities, adding to the four acts54 and four competencies55 agreed upon in 2014.<br/>With continuing protracted conflicts, UNDP is working to increase both the number and capacity of civil society organizations by providing training to improve the implementation of conflict-sensitive interventions at the grassroots level, and enhancing the sustainability of the organizations themselves. The provision of grants to help address shared challenges across the Georgian, Abkhaz and Ossetian ethnic communities is resulting in improved intercommunity relationships, and improvement in well-being and livelihoods. An example is the support to Georgian and Abkhaz ethnic communities to collect anonymized personal stories (micronarratives), in addition to more traditional survey data. This information is used to identify issues of concern across these communities, with a focus on those concerning women and youth. Overall, these grants have seen the number of projects involving people from two or more of the Georgian, Abkhaz and Ossetian ethnic communities increase to 73 percent, or 55 out of a total of 75 projects, and have positively affected over 90,000 conflict-affected people.<br/>Confidence-building among ethnic communities in Georgia is being complemented with more systematic attempts to remove ethnic discrimination. Following on from the adoption of the Law on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, in 2015, UNDP supported efforts to promote equal access to government services for linguistic minorities. This involved UNDP and the Ministry of Justice facilitating the translation of a number of government websites and other resources into the Abkhaz language. Georgian language classes are also being provided for national and ethnic minorities in remote rural destinations to promote their integration into society.<br/>In efforts to improve access to justice, advocacy from UNDP, USAID and the EU led to an extension of the Legal Aid Service mandate from April 2015. As a result, the Legal Aid Service now provides services in selected civil and administrative cases, in addition to those of criminal nature. UNDP also brokered an agreement between the Legal Aid Service and the Public Service Development Agency for working space to be provided for Legal Aid Service lawyers at Public Service Development Agency Community Centres in six rural locations. The Legal Aid Service delivered services to over 30,000 disadvantaged citizens in 2015.<br/>This expansion of legal aid to regional and rural areas was one of several efforts to improve the livelihoods of people outside the major administrative centres. Following up on the Regional Development Strategies and Action Plans approved in 2014, UNDP support for regional and municipal-level strategic planning in six target regions resulted in the implementation of 600 proposed projects. Accordingly, the annual State budget for these regional infrastructure projects has increased from approximately US$63 million in 2014 to US$79 million.56 UNDP also supported 22 pilot municipalities in drafting development plans, and is expected to be followed-up with strategic planning support for all 42 municipalities in the six target regions.<br/>In efforts to promote gender equality, UNDP facilitated a micro-grants programme for rural women’s groups to complete small priority projects in 12 communities. This work included projects such as the rehabilitation of kindergartens, recreational spaces and the organization of specific events for women and youth. The success of these grants and resulting projects have allowed these community groups to secure an additional US$700,000 in funding from local authorities to fix additional problems.'

Already, falls in export revenues and flows of remittances have resulted in GDP growth slowing from 4.6 percent in 2014 to 2.8 percent in 2015.57 The risk is that this slowdown will exacerbate existing socio-economic disparities and divides between ethnic groups. In response, a key priority for UNDP will be promoting inclusive growth and continued support for democratic reforms, with the Sustainable Development Agenda particularly central to policy formulation.<br/>With these economic and political pressures, there is also a risk that potentially less popular reforms, such as implementing existing human rights and gender equality policies, and honouring commitments for increased legislative openness and transparency will become more difficult. To mitigate this, UNDP will work with candidates and parliamentarians from all major parties to ensure they remain committed to reform. UNDP will also work with the EU to encourage a credible and fair election process, in particular by pushing for unbiased and balanced media coverage.<br/>Decentralization also remains an ongoing priority. UNDP plans to continue supporting local self-governance reform with, amongst other things, capacity building of institutions and civil servants (at both the local and national level), to ensure all levels of government are able to manage and facilitate the decentralization process and provide better services to citizens. This will become particularly important with the Government indicating its commitment to fiscal decentralization to municipalities.<br/>UNDP also plans to continue supporting the Georgian Parliament in developing its institutional capabilities, policy-making ability and oversight functions.<br/>Finally, UNDP will be working to improve social cohesion across Georgia. By supporting civil society organizations, UNDP will look to scale-up conflict prevention projects and initiatives that address shared challenges and improve livelihoods across ethnic divides. Continued work will be also carried out in Abkhazia to enhance social inclusion through interventions to improve the quality of life and income generation for rural communities.'

Furthermore, the President has made a commitment to reforms encouraging a multi-party system, while the country has also been exploring ways to decentralize power to the local level, with several initiatives from the Government in this area. To date, however, there is still significant potential for the further decentralization of power to local executive bodies.<br/>Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan has implemented significant public administration and civil service reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government. Nonetheless, more progress is needed in addressing the development challenges facing Kazakhstan. Restrictions on freedom of expression remain, with newspapers and other media outlets presenting dissenting views still subject to closure by authorities. Further improvement is also required to reduce discrimination against ethnic minorities, the LGTBI community and some religious groups.<br/>More recently, Kazakhstan has been playing an active role in attempts to counter violent extremism in Central Asia. In June 2015, Kazakhstan hosted the two-day Central and South Asia Regional Conference on Countering Violent Extremism. Co-organized by the Kazakh and US governments, the event was attended by 200 high-level government officials, representatives of the private sector and civil society activists from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

Following the drafting process, UNESCO and UNDP also initiated a preliminary evaluation of the draft law to assess compliance with the Global Right to Information index. The results of this evaluation were presented in September by the UN common group at the \'Access to Information and Public Participation\' conference organized by the Parliament, OSCE, UNDP and a number of NGO partners.<br/>UNDP also continued its support for the Regional Hub for Civil Service in Astana (the Hub). Established in 2013, the Hub\'s goal is to promote civil service excellence and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best practices among the countries of the region and beyond. The Hub has a range of strategies, including capacity building for people and institutions, building partnerships and networks across borders, and assisting with research and knowledge management. As part of this support, in 2015, UNDP assisted with the launch of the Innovative Solutions Scheme, a grants scheme that supports innovative reforms and solutions in civil service and public administration that have the potential to be replicated in other countries. UNDP also sits on the independent selection committee that selects the most innovative proposals. Membership of the Hub currently includes 34 countries globally.<br/>In work to support the strengthening of the rule of law and human rights, UNDP completed a nationwide survey of 12,206 people in 193 courts to provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the judicial system. The survey results have been made public and posted on the website of the Supreme Court. Further, UNDP worked in partnership with the Supreme Court and OHCHR to deliver regional workshops targeted at judges, prosecutors, policemen and local government representatives to increase knowledge on how UN treaty bodies function, and facilitate discussion on the need for better coordination between government agencies.<br/>Despite high levels of female participation in the work force, women in Kazakhstan continue to suffer from discrimination in many aspects of life.

The successful implementation of these laws is expected to require significant capacity building and experience before yielding results. Going forward, this work to improve transparency and accountability of civil servants and government bodies will be coordinated with the lower house of Parliament (the Majilis) and OSCE to ensure continued respect for the constitutional rights of people to obtain and disseminate information, and take part in decision-making processes.<br/>UNDP\'s work with the Hub will continue. In particular, UNDP will support the development of a long-term strategy for the Hub, factoring in the needs of the participating countries. The results of this process will be recorded in operational and strategy documents. With a long-term strategy in place, support and training will be provided on how to best develop the Hub\'s facilities and resources in line with that strategy.<br/>Work to improve public administration will also be taken to the regions, where UNDP will support efforts to improve the capacities of public councils.

However, challenges remain in regard to the effectiveness and efficiency of many institutions, the effectiveness of rule of law, gender equality, and corruption, which continues to be one of the more significant obstacles to the implementation of reforms. Kosovo has seen progress on inter-ethnic relations since the end of the conflict with a decline of ethnically motivated incidents. Nevertheless, the level of trust between communities remains low, particularly in the four northern municipalities.<br/>The signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Kosovo in November 2015 marked a milestone in Kosovo’s European integration path. During 2015, Kosovo took steps to address the apparent high level of recruitment of Kosovars as foreign fighters,60 with new anti-terror laws that allow for the arrest and conviction of those who participate in foreign conflicts. Kosovo has also developed a strategy and action plan for the prevention of violent extremism. As of 2016, the number of foreign fighters in Syria from Kosovo is believed to have fallen significantly.61<br/>In 2015, Kosovo witnessed a series of mass protests, both inside and outside the Assembly, primarily driven by political differences between the Government and opposition parties on plans to establish a separate association of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo, and the proposed solution to a border demarcation dispute with Montenegro.<br/>Exacerbating the scale and intensity of the protests is the poor state of the economy. A period of relatively rapid economic growth in the 2000s has been followed by slower growth, and has been accompanied by high levels of unemployment, currently over 35 percent62. Labour force participation for women in Kosovo is one of the lowest in the region, with just 21.4 percent of women working or actively seeking work63. This lack of meaningful work for large sections of the population feeds into disillusionment with the political system and the rule of law, which in turn negatively impacts foreign investment.<br/>Despite a strategic framework to combat organized crime, amongst other things, the informal economy, corruption, money laundering and human trafficking, also still remain issues of concern.'

Created in 2012 with UNDP support, the online platform, kallxo.com continues to help fight corruption by engaging citizens and improving the accountability of institutions. In 2015, approximately 5,000 cases of corruption were reported by citizens through the platform, 300 of which were referred to rule of law institutions.

UNDP also helped the Basic and Appeal Courts in the unification of decision and sentencing practices, and by supporting training for judges, prosecutors, and others involved in the legal system on the application of human rights conventions. In efforts to reduce the court and prosecution backlog, UNDP supported the referral of 714 cases to mediation, and invested in the Judicial Institute\'s Initial Education Training Programme that resulted in 16 new judges and prosecutors being appointed.

The strategy aims to address the push and pull factors that influence the radicalization of the population, with special emphasis on youth, and will serve as a guiding document for UNDP and Kosovo institutions to better coordinate efforts in this important area.<br/>Complementin this, the second initiative saw UNDP working with the authorities to restrict illicit arms trafficking. In addition to the destruction of 4,000 weapons and 160,000 rounds of ammunition in 2015 alone, Kosovo introduced new regulations in line with EU legislation that govern the possession of weapons by civilians.

UNDP will assist with the drafting, adoption and monitoring of Integrity Plans in cooperation with 15 municipalities and five central institutions. Support will also be provided to initiatives to corruption-proof legislation, engage the Assembly of Kosovo on the introduction of a Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) Chapter in Kosovo, and to expand the digitalization of public services to include additional services and beneficiaries.<br/>UNDP also plans to expand its work with open data by engaging young people and civil society to facilitate the opening of municipal data across Kosovo, much of which is still not publically available or is not provided in user-friendly formats. Practical training and exchange of experience on the use of data will be an integral part of this work, as well as facilitating the development of new apps based on the data and the needs of Kosovars.<br/>Finally, in efforts to improve rule of law, UNDP will continue to provide strategic and expert advice to several institutions including the Ministry of Justice, Kosovo Judicial Council, Kosovo Prosecutorial Council and Kosovo Judicial Institute. This work has several goals including institutionalising the policy coordination and strategic planning process established in 2015, reviewing and updating the bar exam, increasing access to justice through mediation processes, and the integration of Kosovo Serb judges and prosecutors into Kosovo\'s legal system.'

The tensions in 2010 immediately preceded a successful referendum on a new Constitution, which increased the powers of the Parliament (the Jogorku Kenesh) and reduced the power of the President. Within this new framework, parliamentary elections were held in 2015 with the participation of 14 political parties, six of which gained seats. Overall, international observers found the election process to be open, transparent and conforming with national and international standards.<br/>Establishment of democratic governance, including the fight against corruption, is high on the Government\'s priority agenda. The Public Sector Reform Roadmap64 is the pillar of the strategic framework that is used to pursue governance related initiatives and reforms, with the country remaining committed to continuing the implementation of a number of priorities, including: anti-corruption, the financial mechanism of the judiciary, public finance management, civil service, public administration, energy and electricity, and mining. Still, the establishment of democratic governance in the Kyrgyz Republic faces a number of challenges and problems, as is indicated by low scores on all Worldwide Governance Indicators.65 <br/>The Kyrgyz Republic is now entering a critical period for the country\'s governance and the need to strengthen public faith in the state institutions, fight corruption and uphold the rule of law remains, as well as the need to support peace, stability and sustainable development.<br/>The Presidential elections scheduled for October 2017 will represent a milestone and an opportunity to take stock of the achieved progress, and direct the country towards a more prosperous future that is less impacted by instability and conflicts.<br/>For this reason, it is crucial that institutions entrench democratic governance in order to show how an inclusive parliamentary system based on the rule of law can benefit all citizens, as well as strengthen the social contract. Additionally, in order to meet the targets under Sustainable Development Goal 16, significant efforts will have to be concentrated on continuing support for civil society and improving media freedom, both of which are key requirements for a peaceful, just and accountable state.'

                text: 'With the parliamentary elections occurring in 2015, supporting a credible election was a key priority for UNDP. EMBs were assisted to automate voters\' identification based on biometrics data, and provide voter education and outreach. State authorities, civil society and communities were supported in using risk management tools, including Electoral Risk Management, ensuring timely monitoring of the risks of conflict, as well as the development of recommendations for authorities to take preventive action. Increasing the inclusiveness of the election process was also a priority, with UNDP supporting a number of local women\'s and youth NGOs in advocating the positive image of women in decision-making roles. This programme facilitated meetings with approximately 40,000 people, and resulted in the establishment of a gender rating for the political parties, allowing voters to make a more informed choice.<br/>In efforts to strengthen the rule of law, UNDP assisted the Parliament to draft a package of six new judicial reform laws,66 that are largely in line with human rights standards. UNDP also assisted state authorities to prepare implementation plans and financial assessments for those laws, with civil society contributing to the establishment of formalized plans for cooperation between state authorities. Furthermore, support to the key democratic institutions of the parliament and Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court continued.<br/>Complementing this, UNDP worked to enhance the capacity of free legal aid providers, selected municipalities and the State Registration Service to provide access to justice, legal identity and peaceful dispute resolution. As a result, the number of people who accessed legal aid almost tripled to 14,654 in 2015.<br/>In addition to legal aid provision, UNDP helped improve delivery of a range of public and municipal services. This included elaborating standards for 196 public services, contributing to the implementation of a new e-Governance strategy, and encouraging several public institutions to open public datasets. On the latter, the establishment of an open data portal was a notable achievement, along with the development of user-friendly mobile applications to allow citizens to access the Central Data Bank of legal information maintained by the Ministry of Justice, a free database of more than 79,000 legal documents.<br/>Creating a more inclusive political process, strengthening the rule of law and improving access to justice are seen as keys to reducing violence and tension, but this work was also complemented by a number of conflict prevention and peacebuilding projects. These projects targeted local governance, youth and women\'s empowerment, promoting peacebuilding efforts in the media, and strengthening cross-border cooperation between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. One notable achievement was the development of an action plan for religious policy, containing measures to promote religious tolerance and encourage dialogue at the national and local levels, with the aim of preventing religious radicalization and violent extremism. Complementing this, 11 youth action plans were drafted to target one of the key groups at risk of succumbing to extremism and participation in conflicts – vulnerable youth in disadvantaged and conflict-prone communities. These plans contain measures for bringing at-risk youth together and empowering them to address conflicts, social and economic issues in their communities.UNDP also established another monitoring mechanism to analyse the causes and effects of border conflicts between neighbouring communities of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and offer a response to prevent their reoccurrence. Promoting cross-border cooperation and trust with the aim of mitigating of tensions in cross-border areas contributed to a decrease in the number of border incidents at the Kyrgyz-Tajik border from 33 incidents in 2014 to merely 9 incidents in 2015.68<br/>UNDP worked to promote dialogue and collaboration between the State Agency for Local Self-Governance and Inter-Ethnic Relations (GAMSUMO), local development committees, and communities in at-risk areas. This collaboration focused on conflict analysis and monitoring, inclusive planning of local development, and ensuring the inclusion of marginalized women, youth and minorities. This was complemented by the establishment of a UNDP-supported GAMSUMO Monitoring Centre for Interethnic Relations and 20 regional public reception centres. These centres help to improve monitoring of conflicts, mobilize officials at both local and national levels, and facilitate quicker responses to potential conflicts.'

Over 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty line,69 while the high level of corruption present in the country was reflected by a score of 28/100 on the 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index.70 In addition, recession and sluggish growth in the economies of major trading partners are weighing on economic growth, with GDP growth declining to 3.5 percent in 2015.71 However, as a now full member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the free movement of goods, services and capital across borders is expected to boost trade and economic growth in the future.<br/>Looking forward, UNDP will look to increase its support for legislative reform processes to strengthen the rule of law and the protection of human rights. Previous success has shown the importance of this support extending beyond the drafting stage to assist with the implementation of reforms. UNDP will also continue supporting state institutions and civil society networks to expand access to free legal for citizens and vulnerable populations.<br/>With a focus on improving accountability and transparency, UNDP will increase support for the Parliament to encourage reforms and initiatives that open up decision-making processes to the public. These types of reforms should help not only to make the Parliament more responsive, but also to reduce corruption and encourage politically active citizens. This will be achieved in part through the provision of support to further institutionalize the role of Public Councils within government institutions, and to the Defence Council Secretariat to help identify and combat corruption in various sectors. Furthermore, ongoing support will be provided for voter education and outreach programmes, with a goal of reinforcing the positive changes in electoral system in 2015, and in anticipation of the 2017 presidential elections.<br/>Peacebuilding will also continue be a priority with support provided to ease socio-economic and inter-ethnic tensions, build tolerance, promote reconciliation, and avert radicalization and marginalization. In particular, support for the flagship cross-border cooperation with Tajikistan peacebuilding programme will be increased, focusing on conflict monitoring, encouraging communication between communities, building local infrastructure and fostering local development in the most conflict-prone areas.<br/>Finally, gender inequalities, particularly domestic violence against women and girls remains all too common. Despite a 2003 domestic violence law and a new stronger law in the process of being drafted, many barriers still prevent survivors from accessing help or justice. Raising awareness of these issues and building capacity for an effective responsive will be an important step supported by UNDP.'

                text: 'In the decades since independence, Moldova\'s democratization and development efforts have been slowed by political instability and serious economic challenges, with recent years being no exception.<br/>With the revelation in 2015 of the theft of more than US$1 billion from the country\'s three major banks, Moldova was thrown into a series of political crises, with increasingly vocal opposition from across the political spectrum and repeated mass protests against what was perceived to be corruption at the highest levels of government.72 In September 2015, Vlad Filat, at the time the leader of one of the parties in the ruling coalition, was arrested in connection with the fraud, causing a collapse in support for the coalition. With the latest coalition government under the pro-European "Alliance for European Integration" – led by the Liberal Democrats – falling after a vote of no-confidence in Parliament in October 2015, a new coalition government led by Pavel Filip of the Democratic Party was sworn in at the end of January 2016.<br/>This political crisis was compounded when the Moldovan economy, already one of the poorest in the ECIS region, went into recession in the second half of 2015. Although this was due in part to a particularly harsh drought causing significant declines in agricultural output – a primary source of export revenue for Moldova – it was not helped by the continued political impasse that has prevented the country from implementing effective measures to tackle the economic problems. These recent events have generated significant public distrust for governmental institutions.<br/>Deep political divisions also remain in Moldovan society. In particular, the issue of Transnistria, which declared independence from Moldova after a short but bloody conflict in 1992, remains unresolved. Despite lacking international recognition, a relatively small contingent of Russian peacekeepers remains stationed in the de facto republic.<br/>Despite the challenges, there have been positive developments in recent years, notably the signing of an Association Agreement with the EU in June 2014 and its ratification in 2016, which includes access to the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Moldova also continues to be party to the main human rights treaties and has made efforts to implement its human rights commitments, including the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation and steps taken to prevent torture and ill-treatment.'

                text: 'With improving public trust in public institutions a high priority, UNDP supported the Parliament in conducting an institutional corruption self-assessment and developed an Anti-Corruption Action Plan and Code of Conduct for MPs. Furthermore, to ensure an inclusive process to evaluate the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2015, key representatives from civil society organizations were included in the public hearings. UNDP also supported trainings for 85 parliamentarians and their staff on the proper scrutiny of legislation, with a focus on identifying gender equality considerations and conformity with international human rights obligations.<br/>Significant progress was also made in improving openness and transparency by involving the public and civil society in the parliamentary process. Steps taken included 20 parliamentary public hearings held based on a UNDP pilot, with plans in place to institutionalize the practice; five fact-finding visits to civil society organisations to consult on important policies in the areas of public finance, social protection, human rights, and education; 67 meetings between MPs and citizens were held in the four Parliamentary Constituency Offices established in 2014, resulting in more than 2,000 policy requests and comments; and the Parliament now publically broadcasting all sessions and some Committee meetings.<br/>Jointly with the e-Governance Centre, UNDP is also supporting the Government\'s efforts to reform public administration and service provision through citizen engagement. In 2015, the Moldova Innovation Lab (MiLab) was established, with the goal of deploying user-centred design and policy impact evaluations. Efforts were also focused on developing the capacity of the Central Elections Commission (CEC). With the goal of improving electoral systems and processes, this work resulted in the smooth operation of the IT-based State Register of Voters in the 2015 local elections, contributing to more accurate voter lists. In addition, the newly developed State Automated Information System Elections allowed for real-time monitoring of the voting process and the prevention of attempts of multiple voting. It also reduced the time for preliminary results from 24 hours to 3-4 hours and allowed automated display of results on the official website of the CEC. The capacity development was also extended to CEC staff, where a tailored curriculum was used to train 10,000 elections officials and staff on gender responsive election management and on ensuring access for voters with visual impairments and/or locomotive disabilities.<br/>Moldovan NHRI\'s were also recipients of capacity development programmes, with UNDP helping the People\'s Advocate Office and the Equality Council to improve the quality of their reporting and strengthen their ability to identify and address human rights violations and discrimination cases. The Equality Council was also supported in carrying out the Equality Perceptions Study that provides the baseline level of discrimination and social exclusion of vulnerable groups to serve as the evidence for policy making and targeted service provision. Furthermore, the National Anticorruption Centre was supported in performing a corruption risk assessment of the public procurement system. This assessment aims to identify gaps where corruption can occur and provide recommendations for increasing the transparency and accountability of the public procurement process.<br/>The fiscal decentralization system, previously piloted in 74 localities, was introduced to all first-level local governments across Moldova. It was designed to increase the autonomy and accountability of local authorities in relation to budget management, with supplemental training provided for accountants and mayors on performance budgeting methodology. Furthermore, support for inter-municipal cooperation, led to the establishment of 10 service operators and better services for 60 communities. As a result, more than 10 illegal landfills were cleaned up, over 40,000 people from rural Moldova obtained access to waste management services, 10,000 were provided with street lighting, and over 50,000 will benefit from road maintenance services.<br/>In 2015, the Patients\' Advocate, institutionalized by the Ministry of Health with UNDP support in 2014, processed 1,465 complaints from people held in psychiatric institutions, interviewed patients, and provided information and legal advice. As a result, about 100 cases of forced hospitalization were resolved at the administrative level, with approximately the same number of people released from the institutions or moved to more suitable accommodation. The Patients\' Advocate also brought 29 cases either to court or to the relevant psychiatric institution\'s management.<br/>UNDP has also been working to build confidence between communities on both banks of the Dniester river, including in the Transnistria region. The implementation of an EU-funded programme has resulted in improved services and opportunities for more than 120,000 people by rebuilding schools, medical centres and other facilities, developing business cooperation, and providing grants to civil society. Initiatives also focused on the inclusion of people with disabilities, providing assistance with finding employment, and improving building accessibility. As noted in an external impact assessment "UNDP\'s excellent performance in developmental results, with 41 community infrastructure projects reaching the entire population of the target region (500,000 people), 14,500 beneficiaries in 45 civil society initiatives, over 3,000 graduates of business education in Transnistria, and numerous participants in study tours, international fairs and start-up entrepreneurship." The intervention strategy focused on an integrated cycle of infrastructure rehabilitation, business development and civil society engagement, supplemented by focused initiatives in healthcare and environment. These measures have enabled the expansion of a pro-integration constituency, empowered local actors, and provided greater acceptance of their legitimacy by policy makers, thus creating greater confidence between institutions and citizens\' groups, and more trust among individuals.<br/>One of UNDP\'s major success stories has been working to improve the participation of women in the political process. At a national level, a cross-party Women Caucus in the Parliament was established and immediately engaged with five regional policy forums, where they met with women representing grass-roots organizations and vulnerable groups, and discussed the policy and reform agenda in the context of the SDGs. UNDP also worked directly with nearly 1,000 women candidates to strengthen their political and campaigning skills, contributing to a notable increase in the number and placement of candidates, and the number of women in decision-making positions. Women won 20.6 percent of mayoral elections – more than doubling the number of female mayors – and secured 30.0 percent of the seats in local councils and 18.6 percent in district councils.<br/>Moreover, two Roma women of the seven Roma women registered were elected as local councillors for the first time in the history of Moldova. The increase in Roma candidates, in combination with UNDP voter education campaigns, also contributed to increased voter turnout amongst Roma, for example, in Chetrosu, 98 percent of Roma people voted, compared to approximately 35 percent in the previous election. In the other seven targeted communities, the turnout of Roma voters increased, on average, to 60 percent from 20-25 percent previously.73'

Meanwhile the political instability is also expected to continue. With the first direct presidential elections held in October 2016, it remains to be seen whether this change will help to bridge political divisions. Social cohesion, recovery of public trust, and the ability of the Government to manage fiscal pressure while enacting structural reforms will be key factors for the country getting back on track to European integration and modernization.<br/>The political and economic instability is of particular concern to UNDP due to the impact on development efforts. In 2015, several projects had both their scope and success limited, with the prevention of a planned review of the electoral code, and the postponement of the approval of the Parliament’s Strategic Development Plan two notable setbacks. These will be pushed forward, along with further advocacy efforts for the formal approval of the Code of Conduct and Ethics for MPs.<br/>Looking forward, public sector and civil service reform, as well as a comprehensive reform of the justice system, are some of the most complex and strategically important priorities, particularly given its importance for the goal of joining the EU. As such, UNDP, in collaboration with other UN agencies and partners, will continue to support the implementation of reforms. This will also include assistance to the National Anticorruption Centre to improve its corruption prevention and analysis capabilities, and support for planned police reforms, where the concept of community policing is to be re-conceptualized.<br/>Improving the transparency of the Parliament will also continue to be a key focus, with support planned for the implementation of an e-parliament system and engagement with the Open Parliament initiative. Anticorruption will again be a focus, but in addition, UNDP will support the Parliament to increase engagement with civil society and the public through regional offices. Moreover, UNDP will work to further position the MiLab as a key driver of a new governance model, leading to effective reform of the public administration and gender sensitive public services design.<br/>To assist the Government to meet its human rights commitments, UNDP will support the Ombudsperson’s Office and the Equality Council to contribute more effectively to the protection and promotion of human rights, and to address inequalities and discrimination, focusing on the rights of women, minorities, and marginalized groups. Progress will need to be complemented with improvements in monitoring capacity.<br/>Finally, work to rebuild confidence, trust and cooperation between communities on both banks of the Dniester river remains a priority. UNDP also intends to focus on better integrating the Gagauz Autonomous Region in the reform process across Moldova. This work will target boosting economic development in the region, supporting small and medium entrepreneurs and strengthening local governments’ capacity to deliver efficient, equitable and accessible local public services.'

By the end of 201574, 22 chapters were open for negotiations, including those on the rule of law. In December 2015, Montenegro also received an official invitation to join NATO.<br/>To strengthen rule of law, Montenegro has been implementing constitutional and legislative reforms to enhance the independence of the judiciary through more transparent and merit-based appointment procedures. Specifically, amendments to laws regarding the role of the Ombudsman were adopted in August 2014, with the goal of providing greater independence and strengthening the institution\'s role in combating discrimination. However, despite national legislation concerning human rights being considered up to European standards, further improvements in implementation are required.<br/>While positive political, economic, and social developments are notable, challenges remain in several areas. Specifically, more efforts are needed to fight corruption, reduce inequality and social exclusion, increase civic engagement, and address cases of ill-treatment in police custody and some alleged cases of human rights violations from the 1990s conflict. Further steps also need to be taken to reduce gender inequality and violence against women, and to address discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Reforms are also needed in the area of public administration.

In work to improve rule of law consistency and standards, UNDP provided technical support to the Ministry of Justice to align various frameworks with the Judicial Reform Strategy 2014-2018. This technical support, including an action plan for implementation, should ensure a more consistent and focused approach for the reform efforts going forward. UNDP also provided assistance to the Ministry of Justice in drafting the ICT Strategy for the Justice System 2016-2020, ensuring technology will play an important role in improving justice for all.<br/>Combining efforts to improve rule of law and the protection of human rights, UNDP also facilitated initiatives to address gaps in the legal framework to increase the protection of vulnerable groups. This primarily focused on assessing and strengthening the capabilities of the Ombudsman, and improving the provision and availability of mediation and legal aid.<br/>Reducing gender inequality and preventing gender-based violence is another high priority in Montenegro. In partnership with the Government and civil society organizations, UNDP developed an accredited education programme for judges and prosecutors on domestic violence the protection of women\'s rights.<br/>This was part of a broader effort to establish a more coordinated response to combat domestic violence, which resulted in reported cases increasing by 12.5 percent for criminal offences and 22 percent for misdemeanour cases when compared to 2014. In addition, a National SOS help line for victims of domestic violence was introduced in September. Within two months of the launch, more than 750 phone calls were received, nearly half the total number of reported cases (1,347) in the whole of 2014. UNDP has been credited by all its partners in Montenegro for its work on gender issues and was awarded the UNDP Gold Gender Equality Seal for delivering tangible improvements in gender equality.<br/>Strengthening national and local governance systems to deliver better social services and to generate increased local development are an integral part of UNDP\'s efforts in Montenegro. A structural reform of the social welfare system through introduction of new legislation, the development of social inclusion plans for 21 out of 23 municipalities, the establishment of new social services, and the upgrading of facilities for the provision of social services were some of the key successes in 2015. In addition, the Government\'s new Social Card – Social Welfare Information System, supported by UNDP, integrates with 11 other national systems to deliver a range of benefits, including enabling better targeting and more efficient delivery of services and benefits or transfers, and providing a wealth of data for evidence-based planning.<br/>To improve local governance, UNDP has been working with several municipalities to improve their capacity for attracting investment. This work included helping to develop business zone management plans, promotional materials, and a web portal (www.bizniszona.me). In October, these efforts were presented to 80 investors from 23 countries gathered at the International Investment Conference organized in Podgorica and Kolasin, resulting in investment commitments of €21 million with around 300 jobs expected to be created. In addition, a Study on Identification of Business Zones of Strategic Interest and five pre-investment studies were prepared and finalized, forming the basis for further development of the business zones policy in Montenegro. This was complemented by capacity building activities for seven newly established clusters, with more than 10 cluster project proposals prepared and submitted for funding.<br/>A second initiative focused on reducing and removing barriers for business through the \'No Barriers! So Business Doesn\'t Wait\' Campaign. As part of this project an online platform (www.bezbarijera.me) was established with the aim of identifying and eliminating cumbersome and time-consuming public administration procedures and requirements, particularly at the local level. The platform allows those launching and/or operating a business to report issues and difficulties they encounter, providing vital information to policy makers to allow them to effectively streamline these processes to encourage further investment.'

In order to assist in this process, UNDP will continue to collaborate with the Government on needed reforms, as well as on initiatives that aim to strengthen the accountability of the judiciary. In addition, support will be provided to the Ministry of Justice to upgrade the existing Judicial Information System. In line with government priorities, UNDP will continue to champion technology-based solutions to improve accountability, accessibility and responsiveness of state institutions and the justice system.<br/>Montenegro has made advances in the respect and protection of human rights, including in matters related to the Roma community, the provision of legal aid, and gender equality. However, further steps are needed to fully comply with international obligations and recommendations of human rights bodies. In particular, the current role of the Ombudsperson in dealing with anti-discrimination cases still remains a matter of concern. The establishment of a free legal aid system, which UNDP has supported in previous years, has improved access to justice, but the system still needs to be strengthened technically and financially, as well as ensuring access to justice countrywide. In other efforts to improve social inclusion, UNDP will assist with the implementation of the second phase of the Social Welfare Information System, allowing for the addition of new benefits, improved targeting and more comprehensive coverage. This will be complemented by continued work with the relevant institutions to build capacities and improve cooperation.<br/>Finally, UNDP will continue working to improve political engagement, particularly for women. This will be done primarily through assessments of political parties, trainings on gender sensitivities, and support for the implementation of election related laws such as quotas for female candidates.'

Although tensions remain between Serbia and several countries in the region, Serbia is making efforts to normalize relationships, as evidenced by its continued cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In recognition of Serbia’s progress, and the continued commitment to the normalization of its relations with Kosovo, the EU opened negotiations for membership in 2014.<br/>In 2015, Serbia was one of the main countries affected by the refugee and migrant crisis, as hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants, primarily from Syria, made their way to Western Europe. In a development that could potentially jeopardize the visa-free regime granted to Serbia in 2009, there was also an increase in applications for asylum from Serbian citizens in this period, despite only 1 percent of requests submitted so far in Germany and other EU countries being considered admissible.<br/>2015 was also the first year of an IMF guided programme to improve economic conditions. In recent years, the impact of the international financial crisis and numerous rounds of elections have slowed down necessary structural reforms in the country. However, this programme, which includes measures to reduce the deficit, reform public institutions and improve the business environment, appears to be producing results. In 2015, the deficit almost halved to 3.7 percent and unemployment fell significantly.76Additionally, the economy is expected to return to positive growth after going backwards in 2014.77 Although poverty and unemployment are still prevalent, particularly in the South and Southwest regions which have large minority populations, sustained growth in Serbia would be expected to provide an economic boost to the entire Western Balkans.'

In efforts to improve budget accountability, UNDP supported the launch of a portal that enables MPs to monitor public budget expenditures electronically, replacing the current practice of circulating monthly paper reports produced by the Ministry of Finance. This portal should enable the Parliament and the Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public Spending to subject the Government to additional scrutiny on budgetary issues.<br/>Efforts were also undertaken to increase the openness of the political process, with UNDP supporting 34 public hearings in the Parliament and 18 mobile committee sessions of MPs. The success of this programme has been recognized by national partners as one of the most effective ways to improve transparency and promote public participation in decision-making. It was piloted at the local level.<br/>In another push for increased transparency, UNDP also began the process of introducing open data in Serbia. This included the completion of an Open Data Readiness Assessment with the World Bank, inclusion of the open data standard in the e-Government Strategy, and the publishing of previously unavailable datasets relating to public procurement, education, environmental protection, interior affairs and health. In November, UNDP supported Serbia\'s first Open Data Hackathon, that developed numerous open data enabled applications.<br/>The lack of accountability in the management of public finances is also a significant issue in Serbia. From the initial procurement process to implementation at the local level to the final oversight by the State Audit Institution, significant gaps allow for corruption and the mismanagement of resources. To address this, UNDP supported the certification of over 1,000 public procurement officials, the first audit of political parties, training for judges and prosecutors on procurement law and fraud, and promoting audit findings at the local level.<br/>Combatting corruption was also the goal of an innovative initiative to support investigative journalists embedded in NGOs. Encouraged to report on corruption specifically, this effort resulted in over 100 articles on the subject, of which 20 led to further action from the authorities. Further, UNDP supported the development and work of cross-party caucuses such as the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption, and sponsored the 10th anti-corruption benchmarking survey.<br/>In efforts to reduce SGBV, UNDP facilitated support for the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention (the Istanbul Convention) on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. With Serbia ratifying the convention, UNDP is helping the country meet its standards. This includes improving the quality of and access to SOS hotline services by promoting the inclusion of women\'s NGOs as SOS hotline service providers. UNDP has also been working with 30 municipalities to better coordinate the services required, including health, social protection, the police, the judiciary and civil society. In 2015, positive results are already being seen with the timeliness and adequacy of responses improving in most municipalities.<br/>Complementing this, UNDP is also supporting the Work with Perpetrators programme within the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs. This programme provides individual and group therapy sessions in order to reduce the recidivism rate of the perpetrators of violence.<br/>In Serbia, as in many countries across the ECIS region, ethnic minorities, and Roma in particular, remain vulnerable to poverty and discrimination. In efforts to alleviate the worst effects of poverty in Roma communities, UNDP piloted an inclusive housing model for Roma families in Southwest Serbia, refurbishing houses and constructing additional and legal housing for families formerly living in shacks. With a national Roma inclusion strategy being prepared in 2015, UNDP also continued its work with municipal Roma Coordinators, providing specialized trainings on monitoring and evaluation frameworks, allowing them to more meaningfully contribute to the strategy.<br/>In August 2015, UNDP joined the UN country team in working to address the refugee and migrant crisis, with a focus on supporting local communities to deal with increased pressure on municipal utilities and services. Immediate support was provided in Preševo and Šid, with analysis also completed in other municipalities in preparation for additional work in 2016. UNDP also worked closely with civil society in affected municipalities to strengthen community cohesion during this difficult time.'

It is also expected that reform efforts will be helped by improving economic conditions, and a reduction in the large flows of refugees and migrants.<br/>For UNDP, a key priority will remain providing assistance and support for reforms required for EU membership, as well as encouraging further normalization of relations with Kosovo and other countries in the region. As part of these efforts, support will be provided to joint initiatives on war crimes involving prosecutors from Serbia, Croatia and BiH.<br/>Work will also continue on parliamentary openness and accountability in the management of public finances. New phases of the projects on parliamentary development and accountability in public finance management are planned, and will include opening data on procurement and public finance.<br/>Partnerships with municipalities will expand to help them manage the pressure on their infrastructure and services posed by migrants and refugee flows, as well as work on social cohesion and inclusiveness. This will be complemented by 30 additional infrastructure projects. Furthermore, to better prepare municipalities for emergency situations and disasters, UNDP has several initiatives planned. This includes a large programme covering 27 municipalities to improve emergency response abilities, and a conference on gender in disaster risk reduction that will serve as a platform to identify recommendations for future work.<br/>In work to assist at-risk groups, UNDP will contribute to a new UN cross-agency project that will look to address challenges faced by women, youth and Roma. The main focuses of the project will be combatting violence against women, encouraging participation in regional initiatives to support the LGBTI community, and maintaining the dialogue on Roma inclusion.<br/>Finally, in recent years, Serbia has passed significant reforms in rule of law, including the implementation of the 2013-2018 Strategy on Judicial Reform. However, further efforts are needed to safeguard the judiciary\'s effectiveness and independence, and to ensure the adoption of key pieces of legislation. UNDP plans to continue providing support and assistance to implement needed reforms in this area.'

As a result, the economic slowdown in Russia and other Central Asian countries has resulted in an estimated 33 percent drop in the US dollar value of remittances79, significantly impacting the Tajik economy.<br/>Over the last decade, the Tajik Government has undertaken a number of policy and legislative reforms to bring its legislation into line with international standards, including the creation of a framework for an effective justice system. However, the implementation of these reforms remains challenging due to a lack of national capacities and resources. Furthermore, in the absence of a unified legal aid system, many people, particularly in marginalized communities, face difficulties accessing justice. Corruption also continues to be perceived as widespread, although the Government\'s efforts to fight corruption are resulting in gradual improvements, with Tajikistan\'s Corruption Perceptions Index score increasing from 22/100 in 2013 to 26/100 in 2015. 80<br/>In early September 2015, national security entities in and around the capital Dushanbe faced an armed attack, resulting in more than 20 deaths. There were also serious political consequences, with the leading opposition party – the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan – being designated a terrorist group and numerous members of the party arrested.<br/>Tajikistan\'s geographic location also presents external security risks. Concerns are primarily focused on Tajikistan\'s proximity to, and unsecure border with Afghanistan, but in 2014-2015, tensions also re-emerged on Tajikistan\'s border with the Kyrgyz Republic. The tensions between Tajiks and Kyrgyz in the Fergana Valley were provoked by disputes over transport links, access to water and border demarcations.

In 2015, 11,206 people, including 7,021 women and 865 people with disabilities, received legal aid services, with over 85 percent of recipients reporting positive outcomes. UNDP also worked to improve the long-term viability of these services, facilitating a discussion between the Government and civil society organizations on state support for free legal aid. As a result, the concept of state guaranteed legal aid was developed and adopted, and a new state agency providing free legal aid was created. A transition strategy for the gradual takeover of the existing, donor-funded system of free legal aid by the government budget was also developed.<br/>Some of UNDP\'s most successful programming in Tajikistan in recent years has been supporting the work of the Ombudsman\'s Office to promote human rights. In addition to assisting with the development of the Ombudsman\'s new Strategy for 2016-2020, UNDP provided trainings to Ombudsman\'s Office staff on a range of topics, including the rights of persons with disabilities, gender issues, and the international standards for documenting and collecting evidence for torture cases. In addition to the training, a successful study visit was conducted to the Finnish Ombudsman\'s Office in Helsinki with the participants having since developed a number of specific recommendations that are now being implemented. Furthermore, to extend the reach of the Ombudsman\'s Office, six regional consultation centres provided advice and legal aid to over 2,000 people across the country, while outdoor legal information sessions were also held in a number of locations on family legislation, labour law, and human rights, reaching an additional 5,200 people.<br/>UNDP is also supporting Tajikistan with accession to the CRPD. As part of this process, a large study on the costs and benefits of accession was carried out and a ministerial-level conference held with the participation of over 100 representatives of the Government and civil society, along with a visiting delegation from Kazakhstan. CRPD accession has now been approved at the ministerial level, and is expected to go to the Government for final approval in the near future. Complementing this, efforts were made to improve public awareness and perceptions of disability, with seven TV programmes on disability broadcast a total of 18 times on national television.<br/>In efforts to boost inclusive governance, UNDP supported a set of Policy Dialogue platforms, bringing civil society and NGO representatives together with government stakeholders. Two policy dialogues were conducted at the national level, and two at the regional (oblast) level, in Khujand and Kurgan-Tyube. Additionally, UNDP supported Tajikistan\'s first National Rule of Law Forum, which brought together over 150 participants, including government officials, donors, civil society, lawyers and academics, to discuss key issues relating to the rule of law in Tajikistan, and to make concrete recommendations for law and policy changes.<br/>In view of Tajikistan\'s vulnerability to external security risks, enhancing border management capacities remains critical. Since the beginning of 2015, UNDP training on subjects such as border management skills, counter narcotics, engine mechanics, gender sensitivity, disaster risk reduction and other topics associated with integrated border management have been provided to 322 Tajik and Afghan border and customs officials, including 28 females. To ensure greater donor coordination and more efficient use of available technical and financial resources going forward, UNDP has consolidated its border management programmes funded by the EU (Afghanistan) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Tajikistan) under one management umbrella.<br/>In the Fergana Valley, UNDP offices in both Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic cooperated to conduct a community-level conflict analysis and establish a monitoring system. Based on the results of this monitoring, dialogue was started in conflict-prone cross-border communities, which helped to identify community initiatives with a potential to reduce tensions. 17 small-scale community infrastructure projects (e.g. irrigation water, social infrastructure) were selected and six of them have already been implemented to improve the access of local communities to natural resources and promote joint management of common goods. A larger Cross-border Cooperation for Sustainable Peace and Development programme was also launched, bringing together five UN agencies from Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.<br/>To address tensions between border communities, and the risk radicalization and violent extremism more generally, UNDP supported and contributed to a UNICEF produced report looking at the reasons behind the marginalization and exclusion of adolescents and youth in Tajikistan. This report will allow for a better understanding of the issues impacting this at-risk group, something vital for all development agencies seeking to mitigate risks and understand the drivers of marginalization and exclusion.<br/>With corruption and transparency still significant concerns, UNDP has been working to improve the openness of the Tajik authorities and institutions. To this end, UNDP supported the establishment of mmk.tj, a website that includes a free, publicly available database of Tajik laws and regulations. UNDP also provided support for a section of the Ministry of Justice website to be dedicated to providing information on notaries, their location and services, and relevant laws and regulations.'

Turkey has invested heavily in providing humanitarian support to Syrians and others fleeing violence, with more than 2.7 million refugees now registered.96 However, large numbers of refugees are also leaving the country for the EU, occasionally with tragic consequences. In response to the loss of life and the large numbers of asylum seekers entering Europe, the EU and Turkey entered negotiations in November 2015, reaching an agreement for Turkey to help stem the flow of people to Europe in return for funding for the response to the refugee and migrant crisis, visa-free travel for Turkish citizens, and renewed talks on joining the EU.<br/>Domestic tensions also increased in 2015. The peace process with the armed Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) was suspended in July, resulting in a number of violent incidents, predominantly in the southeast of the country. This breakdown came in the aftermath of the first of two general elections held in 2015. The first election resulted in a hung Parliament, leading to a second election being called in November, with the AKP returning to power.<br/>Despite the political situation, Turkey has continued to push for reforms in key areas. The challenging reforms required for EU alignment, particularly those aimed at strengthening rule of law, fostering human rights and democracy, are further complicated by increasingly polarized political and social settings. Recent developments, many of which were addressed in the Outcome Document of the 2015 UPR, have also led to concerns over the adequacy of checks and balances, the independence of institutions such as the judiciary, protections of freedom of speech, privacy, and restrictive censorship.'

Many of the recommendations provided by UNDP were reflected in the draft, including a proposal for a specific target for the handling of gender-based complaints. A capacity assessment of the Ombudsman Institution was also conducted, contributing to the Strategic Plan development process and was communicated to the Prime Minister\'s office. The draft strategic plan is currently being reviewed by the Ombudsman Institution and the Ministry of Development. The UNDP and the Ombudsman Institution\'s joint project is considered an important step forward on the eve of the establishment of new institutions that will focus on anti-discrimination and equality, as well as independent oversight for law enforcement. The knowledge and experience gained during this process also resulted in long-term cooperation agreements being signed between the Turkish Ombudsman Institution and five similar institutions in Europe<br/>To further improve the existing public administration, UNDP remains a strong advocate for the use of technology in expanding the effectiveness and efficiency of government services. As part of a wider effort to support e-governance, UNDP supported the enhancement and expansion of the e-visa system, with the number of users reported to have increased significantly to over 6 million. The e-consulate system, which was also developed with the support of UNDP, has also shown significant improvements, and improved the speed of services even as demand has increased.<br/>UNDP also invested considerable resources into promoting the human rights of disadvantaged groups. Under a grant program aimed at empowering women, 20 projects involving 8,646 people across 11 provinces enhanced the ability of civil society to support the effective implementation of gender-related policies at the local level. Building the capacity of local NGOs and universities enabled the establishment of independent monitoring mechanisms for gender-related policies, and improving communication and cooperation between different organizations and communities. Efforts to push for gender-sensitive policymaking and anti-corruption were also implemented at the local level, where grassroots women groups were enabled to provide feedback on the integrity plans of their local municipalities.'

To this end, the restructuring process underway in the Turkish public administration system provides a new opportunity for UNDP to ensure that changes are adopted and implemented in line with international norms and standards, with one example being the improvement of civilian oversight of internal security sector under the new structure of gendarmerie and police in Ministry of Interior. UNDP\'s role in this new environment will be critical in settling the relations between the responsible institutions and developing the accountability of security forces in order to prevent casualties in the current challenging environment.'

                text: 'Following independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the economy of Turkmenistan has developed significantly, outperforming its Central Asian neighbours. With a GDP per capita of US$6,947.80 in 2015,97 Turkmenistan is now considered an upper-middle income country. Much of this economic growth is due to large reserves of oil and gas, including the world\'s fourth largest natural gas reserves. This has enabled the Government to invest significantly in nation-building and renovating its cities, particularly the capital Ashgabat. However, with the fall of commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, a lack of economic diversification is expected to lead to a significant slowdown. To some extent this can already be seen in the country\'s GDP growth, which fell to 6.5 percent in 2015, significantly down on the greater than 10 percent growth rates seen between 2011 and 2014.98 To counter the problem, the Government is prioritising economic diversification, announcing a plan to increase revenues from non-hydrocarbon sources to 70 percent by 2030.<br/>A participant in international human rights mechanisms, Turkmenistan is only now looking to establish a NHRI in accordance with the Paris Principles, with the Law on Ombudsman adopted in late 2016. All issues pertaining to the obligations of Turkmenistan under the UN treaty bodies are coordinated by the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan. As the result of the constitutional review process, in 2016 Turkmenistan adopted a new Constitution that was widely commented on by the UN, OSCE and other international partners.<br/>In December 2015, Turkmenistan celebrated the 20th anniversary of its UN-recognized status of positive neutrality. This policy has provided Turkmenistan with stability in foreign policy, but in the early 2000s also contributed to international isolation. In recent years, Turkmenistan has increased engagement with the international community, as is reflected by its election to a number of international boards and committees. In addition, for the first time in 12 years, Turkmenistan sent a delegation to the annual Human Dimension Implementation Meeting of the OSCE in 2015. Turkmenistan has also taken steps towards a climate-friendly future, with the Government declaring an intention to approve an action plan to move toward a green economy.'

                text: 'UNDP continues to advocate for improvements in human rights and the freedom of expression in Turkmenistan. On this front, 2015 was a milestone year with reports to three human rights treaty bodies, and the finalization a National Human Rights Action Plan for 2016-2020 based on the recommendations of the 2013 UPR and other treaty bodies. UNDP also provided technical support to the Parliament and the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights (NIDHR) on the development of legislation for an Ombudsman Institution, and the establishment of an Institute of the Ombudsman as the NHRI. For the benefit of NIDHR and the Parliament, UNDP also worked jointly with OHCHR and the EU to present the best practices for the Institute of the Ombudsman to forty members of the working group, and provided suggestions for what model could best function in Turkmenistan.In efforts to improve the quality of governance, as well as decentralize decision-making, UNDP assisted the Parliament to conduct a review of the administrative, legal, and financial systems of local governments in order to develop a list of proposals for improvement. The resulting recommendations focused on providing more independence to local communities and their representative bodies, strengthening their ability to participate in the formation of local plans for socio-economic development, and giving them the ability to approve and monitor public spending at the local level. The proposals were received by the Parliament and will serve as a basis for a planned revision of the local governance system. Furthermore, UNDP supported the Government in preparing a road map for the development of the Civil Service Academy, a project that will be co-funded by the Government as part of the 2016-2020 programme.<br/>UNDP has also been working to address the underrepresentation of women in politics and leadership positions. To this end, UNDP helped to facilitate the active participation of the chairwoman of the Assembly of Turkmenistan, Akja Nurberdiýewa, at several international events, including the 10th Meeting of Women Speakers of Parliaments and the 4th World Conference of Speakers of Parliament.<br/>Finally, assisting the Government with the constitutional review, UNDP engaged international experts to provide information and guidance on the best practices of constitutional democracies. The resulting draft Constitution was published for public discussion in the national newspaper. UNDP is providing an extensive review and recommendations on the new draft of the Constitution, which was adopted in 2016.'

                text: 'The immediate challenge facing Turkmenistan is the economic impact of the fall in commodity prices. With declining tax revenues and a likely increase in unemployment, efforts will be needed to ensure vulnerable groups are not left behind and that important reforms continue to be implemented. As such, UNDP will continue working with the Government to further initiatives started in 2015, such as the establishment and strengthening of the Civil Service Academy, the creation of an Ombudsman Institution, and the implementation of the Human Rights Action Plan.<br/>UNDP will also work with the Government to strengthen its employment and labour policies, improve training for public servants, and develop the Government\'s capacities to deliver services to the population in a modern, effective, and transparent way. At the same time, UNDP plans to continue providing the Government with assistance to empower people with disabilities, focusing both on policy development and creating national mechanisms that promote the social integration of this section of the population.<br/>UNDP will also continue to support the Turkmen authorities to engage with the international community. Particular importance will be placed on encouraging cooperation and coordination with neighbouring governments in Central Asia to solve regional challenges, and on drawing lessons from successful examples of programmes and reforms in those countries.<br/>Lastly, UNDP will continue working with the Government to incorporate the SDGs, which were approved by the Government of Turkmenistan in September 2016, into the broader vision of national development – particularly SDG 16. One high priority in this area will be supporting the integration of SDGs into the new President\'s socio-economic development plan for 2017-2021. Overall, UNDP will continue advocating for a more open society which, evidence suggests, will encourage an innovative and entrepreneurial culture that could provide large benefits to the Turkmen people and their economy.'

                text: 'Due to its abundance of fertile farmlands, Ukraine has long been a major exporter of various agricultural products. The country also has a diversified industry that manufactures a range of products from steel and iron products, to jet engines and railway cars. With high levels of education and an extensive social protection system, it has enjoyed relatively high levels of human development in the past. In recent years however, Ukraine has faced a series of challenges that have stalled needed reforms and aggravated many existing problems. Institutions, which often date back to the Soviet era, have become frail and increasingly vulnerable to corruption.<br/>Over the past two years, Ukraine struggled with the twin challenges of post-revolutionary political reform and the defence of its territorial integrity. These challenges arose out of a series of events starting in 2013, when then President Viktor Yanukovych suspended negotiations on an association agreement with the EU. This decision resulted in large protests in Kiev and eventually snowballed into the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, known as Maidan for the square where the protests took place. As a result, President Yanukovych fled the country, and was subsequently removed from his position by the Parliament, leading to early elections. This in turn was followed by the Russian annexation of Crimea and conflict with armed separatists in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.<br/>The ongoing conflict in the Donbas region has created a humanitarian crisis, with significant loss of human life and more than 1.5 million people displaced99 – a situation that, if not resolved, may drive further conflict, worsen the country\'s already dire economic situation, and erode confidence in government. The conflict has had a large negative economic impact, including currency devaluation, high inflation, a credit crunch and slowdowns in the economies of neighbouring countries, and estimates that real GDP decreased by 6.8 percent in 2014 and by a further 10 percent in 2015.100 In addition, the conflict has impinged on the human rights of individuals living in conflict-affected regions, and further exacerbated issues such as inequality, social exclusion, and a lack of trust among communities.<br/>Yet, Ukrainians are showing a strong commitment towards democracy, with the new political leadership pursuing a comprehensive reform agenda, and civil society, including human rights organizations, playing an important role during and after the revolution. In this regard, 2015 was a critical year for Ukraine, not only in terms of efforts towards economic and political stabilization and reform, but also in terms of seeking a peaceful settlement to the armed conflict in the east of the country.'

The post-2014 coalition government has developed Ukraine\'s most comprehensive governance reform programme to date, which emphasizes anti-corruption, rule of law and decentralization reforms in line with European standards. Important reform initiatives include new open data legislation, a State Anti-Corruption Programme for 2015-2017, and the launch of the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption. All of these developments were supported by UNDP. <br/>Since 2008, UNDP has been working to empower rural communities to take part in the decisions that affect their lives. Using a community-based approach, UNDP has helped to facilitate joint decision-making and bottom-up planning processes, leading to the development of local partnerships and real improvements in people\'s lives. In 2015, the living conditions of more than 600,000 people were improved through 500 micro-projects, including the installation of water pipelines, energy efficient street lighting and windows, and the renovation and reequipping of local kindergartens and rural health clinics.<br/>There were also important achievements for human rights, with the first National Human Rights Strategy and Action Plan being adopted following an inclusive process involving civil society, the Government and a number of development partners. UNDP also funded the development of the National Human Rights Strategy portal (http://hrstrategy.com.ua/) by the Ministry of Justice, promoting the engagement of public institutions and individuals in the development of the strategy. The UNDP-supported international conference on the specific topic of the role of NHRIs in conflict and post-conflict situations resulted in the signing of the Kyiv Declaration, which calls for a stronger role for NHRIs in conflict and post-conflict settings. The Kyiv Declaration was adopted and signed by 19 NHRIs.'
